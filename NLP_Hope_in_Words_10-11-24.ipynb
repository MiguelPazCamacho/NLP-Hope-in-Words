            "subject1064***SEPARADOR***First time at RTX So I'm thinking about going to RTX London this year as I live in England so London is really convenient for me but it is my first time going to any convention and I'll be going alone. I'm not a super sociable person either. Any first convention tips or tricks I should know? How busy does it get as I sometimes struggle with crowds? Is it worth trying to get VIP tickets? Thank You!!! Musical help!!!! That I have depression and Anxiety. I only had to face this when I was put on antidepressants. I'm scared Hey, I'm probably not one to talk about the social aspect since I'm the one who posted this in the first place but in terms of age I get why that would seem weird. Hell, when I go I'll only be 16! But I don't feel like age will be an issue. Rooster teeth creates content that can be enjoyed by all ages so you going enforces that! Besides, I very much doubt that you'll be the only older attendee there... I'm pretty sure that there are loads of other people wondering the same thing so I think you shouldn't worry about it (she says being a massive hypocrite with an anxiety disorder) and enjoy yourself! I'm pretty sure I'm going to go despite my worries! : ) Birthday painting for my mother I'm currently trying to write my very first musical and I've got the story and characters as well as the lyrics to one song. I'm 15 and live in a rural town in England. I don't have and don't know how to find any actors, choreographers, musicians as I can't write sheet music very well or a location to put it on once I've actually written it! Also if anyone has any tips on writing songs and scripts that would be very much appreciated. Thank you. How? Thank you so much! This is awesome advice and I'll be sure to message you when I need more help! Thank you! \"I'm...\" pen on lined paper I've never been an artist (not a good one anyway!) but I wanted to throw this out there as a 5 minute doodle after hearing my grandmother (who taught me that it's okay not to be okay sometimes) is in hospital again. Thank you very much, luckily I have a few friends that share the similar ideas as me for this piece so hopefully I can go to them for support and a second opinion! \"I'm...\" pen on lined paper I'm not much of an artist (not a good one anyway, might be why this drawing was removed by r/art) but I wanted to throw out this 5 min drawing that I did just now after I was told that my grandmother (who told me it's okay to not be okay) is in hospital. Thank you for your advice, the idea of once I have a complete draft I can enter it into festivals is amazing! I didn't really think of doing anything like that but it would be so good to see what can be kept and what can go! I hope you keep writing as well! I'm a bit overloaded at the moment as I have exams but writing is really relaxing for me so I'll make sure I keep it up! Thank you! Please help Ooh I'll look into that! It sounds pretty good especially since finding new melodies for songs is pretty difficult! Thank you! Advice needed This looks pretty useful so thank you! I'll be sure to watch a lot of musicals especially since they make up most of my life!  #128523; Thank you! Best route? Although I live in a rural area of southern England I'm really scared about the recent terror alerts and attacks. I'm only about an hours train ride from London and I have family in the surrounding area. All this news scares me and I don't know what to do about it. I'm 16 so I can't vote or anything if there were some sort of referendum on the topic. I don't want to be afraid because that's what terrorists want but I don't know how else to react. I'm seeing so many people responding this with hate such as \"ban the burka\" or \"close all mosques\" and I hate that. I refuse to fight fear with hate but I don't know how to feel. Any help would be much appreciated. X After over a month of waiting (as I had to get a different size than I thought due to my weirdly proportioned shoulders) I FINALLY GOT A PROPER BINDER!!!!! I have managed to get stuck in it several times but I am so happy! It's my mums birthday in October and she is absolutely in love with a painting by Jo Quigley that is in the window of a shop in our village; however, it is  #163;349 which we can't afford but I want to save up and get it for her birthday. I worked it out and if I'm really good at not spending money and I have a job by July then I will have enough money in 3 months time. The issue is that I don't have the money now so I can't have the shop keep hold of it for me as I asked and they said I'd have to pay. If you have any tips on how I might be able to get money quicker or ensure that they can keep hold of it for me ( I was thinking of giving them a deposit but they didn't know if they could do that) then I would really like to hear them! I am 16 years old but currently don't have a job despite having been applying for a few months now but I should have one by July otherwise I won't have enough money. Thank you! Chloe. An example of my handwriting, advice very much appreciated especially on how to keep handwriting consistent Unfortunately not, the only job I could do would be babysitting but my mother says she doesn't want me doing that. I'm looking into retail and care assistant roles near me but have been turned down for a few months now. I'm volunteering at a charity shop to get experience so hopefully that will help, Depresseddreamer's circle I am 16 and identify as female but I wear a binder because it makes me feel more comfortable in my body as someone who is very boyish. I have B cup breasts and recently bought my first binder from the internet for a very low price so it's probably not the best quality but I'm saving up to get a proper one by beginning of 2018 hopefully. My problem is though that despite already having the worlds smallest boobs I feel like my binder is too loose and doesn't flatten them to the level that I want them to. Is there anyway to DIY tighten a binder bearing in mind that it is a clasp type one on my side and is very breathable currently to the point that I wonder if it's actually doing anything. Thank you and sorry if this is an off topic question, I'm new here! Chloe x Help please Hello, I am 16 and currently work in a canteen like restaurant in which I serve hot food on hot plates next to and using a very hot pizza fire without proper arm protection (fair to say, not good) I feel that my current work is damaging my already weak mental state as I take antidepressants but because I can't seem to get the job right and I keep messing up its making me miserable. I spoke with my mother about the situation and she said that my generation were \"snowflakes\" and that no one likes there job so I need to \"deal with it\". I also spoke to my college career advisors who said that the environment could damage my mental wellbeing and strongly suggested I seek other employment. I don't know what to do. I'm miserable and self harming again and most days I'm wishing I was dead but I'm getting conflicting messages. No one at my job finds it fun even the managers don't like it there and I would talk to them but they are terrifying. I was taken into the back office yesterday and shouted at because I wasn't wearing my name badge because I forgot it at home despite my apologies.

            "subject1105***SEPARADOR***Anyone remember when Deftones went the reggae (kinda) rout? Xerxes chest rose and fell with the swelling of the seas. \"My lord. We have just lost another archer ship! We must turn back! We could lose the entire fleet!\" \"Steadfast admiral, we push for the beaches tonight, or we die.\" \"But my lord, the ships have just disappeared! If there are rocks ahead we will never see them coming!\" \"Must I remind you the consequences of questioning a god, you may ask your predecessor that question!\" Xerxes voice boomed throughout the dimly lit chamber. The servants and women struggled to keep their bowels, any repulsive behavior could result in death for even his favorite maidens. The admiral left the room after receiving his bearings again. Xerxes prepared his mind for the battle ahead. The Spartans were never easy to put down, and that is exactly the kind of thinking Leonidas was counting on. Leonidas looked out at the sea, at first his men were roaring and jeering with pride and celebration when the Persians crashed on the rocks. But festivities soon turned to debates. The warriors stood at attention at the cliffs, waiting to see another Persian be claimed by the grey blue ocean. It began with a few scout boats, but then the larger ones began to disappear as well. One minute they were there, the next, it appeared the mist took them. The men stood puzzled as Leonidas shook the crumbling earth in one hand, his spear in the other, searching for answers. The men began to sense his worry as well. Picking up on the men's doubt, Leonidas's lieutenant called out to them \"The gods deny the Persians victory! The might of the Spartans are so strong the Persians shiver at the thought of us!\" The men regained some of their lost morale, but everyone knew something was strange. The lieutenant ushered the men back to their posts and dimly walked over to Leonidas. \"What is it?\" \"Its not right, boats shouldn't disappear like that.\" \"And the men know it as well, it would perhaps be best not to let the rest back at camp come to this realization.\" \"hmph\" \"Could this be some kind of new trick, the Persians are indeed a slithering lot.\" \"They aren't that clever, they know they overwhelm us and they know it. Trying to hide their ships would only show weakness, something a Xerxes wishes not to show if he wishes to continue the fiction of his godhood.\" \"Indeed. We shall see come morning, we must gather our strength for the morning, let us return to camp.\" \"I suppose that would be wise\" grunted Leonidas, lifting his shield and using his spear as leverage. The two began down the path, the Persians would engulf their sleep. It was the dawn of the fourth day. If it were not for the occasion it would be heavenly. The summer winds blew threw the Hot Gates, passing through the last of the blooming olive trees and delivering the sweet smell of nectar from flowers buried in the nearby valley. The sweat on the brow of each Spartan reflected the glorious sun that hung hot in a sky devoid of clouds. Seabirds flocked above, catching fish in their mouths fresh from the turquoise sea. Leonidas looked down defiantly from atop a hill. Word had come that the Persians were expecting his forces to disperse. That, of course, would never come to light. But it had appeared that Xerxes waited long enough. A cooler breeze swept through the gates to the relief of the men standing in the sun. It was only a matter of time now. Xerxes had become worried now, but he did not let it show. The fleet had suffered greatly in the storm a week before, the navigators are still puzzled. However it did not matter now. Now only death was on Xerxes mind, that and the burning of Greece. The first 20,000 men were already engaged with the Spartans and the rest were on their way. As his throne reached the top of the brown mossy hill he could hear the sounds of his front infantry engaged in combat. \"Impossible.\" he whispered. From his side, a voice called out to one of the generals. The messengers words reached Xerxes divine ears by way of his most trusted general \"Your Highness, the battlefield brings news.\" \"Speak\" \"My lord, we are getting reports of... beats, rising from the water.\" \"Beasts you say?\" asked Xerxes, becoming intrigued. The poor general struggled to make pace with the bulky slaves march, carrying a God is something you don't take lightly, after all. \"And what do these beast look like?\" \"Well sir, they are a common animal, you may know them, they are said to swallow fallen sailors whole!\" \"What do the Beasts *look* like?\" anger rising in his voice. \"Well, my lord, they are, um. They're sharks my king.\" \"Sharks? On land?\" \"Not just any, it has been told that they carry a device on their heads sir, it carries the power of the great sun god with...\" and before the general could finish his sentence, his head seemed to disappear from his body. A bit perplexed, Xerxes stared at the headless charred body, trying to pull meaning from it, but before he could finish his thought; his throne slowed down as it came over the hill. The throne lowered suddenly, followed by a scream, and another, and another. Xerxes jumped from the falling platform and crawled up to the hill. Where were his servants? His soldiers? Had they not seen their king fall? But this soon became the least of his worries. As he gazed out over the battlefield laid before him, he could only stop and wonder. And wonder he would, until his head disappeared, just like his generals. The world went black. Leonidas watched in interest at the field before him. He could hear the calls of his lieutenant by his side, but instead he simply watched. The lieutenants wisdom would not be needed, he had seen this all before. Laser sharks. Leonidas raised his spear and shield, his red cloak flowing in the wartime breeze. \"Men! Tonight we dine, in hell!\" cried the King. Soon not only would the blood of Persians fill the seas, but that of Laser sharks as well. [WP]You wake up in an eerie abandoned town. You have a note next to you. It says \"5 minutes\" Thanks a lot!

That's was pretty incredible writing! That was an awesome story and kinda want to hear what happens next Dear attractive people. What are some downsides to being good looking? I saw the light burn out from his eyelids. The fiery green stars collapsed under the weight of their own mass, and the vessel fell to the cool hard pavement below.A cool breeze set in as sweat evaporated from every pore of the corpse. The white hot star fire shone down to reap the flesh it had once birthed. I stood and observed this for a long while, trying to comprehend the nature of this drama. Then the ants came, and the birds circled ahead. The once breathing and frantic body was being reclaimed by nature. I stood back from all this, from the rotting flesh, the birds, and into the cool shade, where the same sun that devoured a man could not reach me. I could see its effects on his skin, which began to blister and spoil and collapse, and the smell began to set it. Why? Why did this man fall before me? I asked myself the question over and over again like a madman. I felt the cool soft shape of paper in my hand. Had the man given it to me? It certainly did not fabricate itself in my pal. I opened the paper cautiously. scrawled upon its yellow faded surface were the words One Minute Ten seconds it took to ponder. Another ten to realize. Ten seconds to run down the street. Fifteen to fear the sun. Five to fear the birds. Five to finally see another man. Five to drop dead into his arms. [WP] You are the man who sold the world.

Keep up the good work man! What song (or band) made you actually afraid? Three sets of lights danced around the bar. Blue red and yellow sparkled across the crystal bar. The ambiance of clinking glasses and laughter filled the musty old cantina with a sense of belonging. Waitresses made their rounds and news reports sought to suffocate the patrons fun with tales of bloody civil war and the latest galactic scandals. In vain, it seemed, as the multi species concoction stirred within the small and dim hole in the wall. Tales from miners and scouts that had returned from the belt regions swirled with the average office workers drama. The occasional rumbling of the hyper tram rattled the establishment, but rarely spilled the vetted drinkers glasses. Waitresses of all races in skimpy diner outfits buzzed around the bar like olives in Jonathan's cocktail. One of the robotic models whirred over to our table. I had to order for him, he seemed out of it, he had already bumped into a waitress before with his antlers because he wasn't careful. A million apologies and a promised payment for the glasses later he back zoning off. He wasn't himself, where had the usually sly and smooth Jon gone? He was a hit with the ladies, even for a Tarisan. Hell, one time my buddy Jon slept with a Mon Schuti, on a bet of course; no one would touch that any tentacles, except my best friend Jon. One time we were at this herb shop while Jessica was pregnant we had to pick up a medication for her morning sickness, as we were leaving he told me he forgot something in the store, I said okay and he trotted his way back in. He comes out with this slimy bottle of stuff that looked like you left floaters in someones water. He starts telling me that its supposed to increase stamina or something like that, anyway, he convinces my dumb ass to down the entire bottle. I was shitting in my pants for five days. But hey, that was Jon for you. Of course, he wasn't always an asshole. He flew me to the hospital when I tried to OD, that was before I met Jessica of course. The only reason I'm alive today alive today. But this isn't really my story, this is about Jonathan. The robotic waitress brought our order to the table. \"Why the cocktail?\" \"Never had one\" replied Jonathan in a booming voice, he put his hooves through the utensil gloves and begun to shove chowder in his mouth. \"You're eating diner with a cocktail?\" \"I don't see the problem with it man.\" \"Don't you have to work tomorrow?\" \"I guess so.\" \"I mean Jesus man if somethings wrong you should just tell me.\" \"Nothings wrong.\" \"Sure?\" \"Sure.\"He said jadedly.I began to pull away at the fried coruscation on my plate, cracking the red and orange outer shell and stripping the soft gooey insides. I looked up at him, the look on his face was one of deep thought. He had begun picking at his food. \"Have you even been to Esterik 9?\" he asked out of the deep blue. \"No I cant say I haven't. Why?\" \"Ive always wanted to visit there, they have lots of beaches, and the population is relatively low so there's a lot of real estate and great nature areas, i've been thinking about going there.\" \"Would you take Tanya there?\" Tanya was the given human name for his mate. I couldn't pronounce their native names, so Jon and Tanya always had to do. \"Yeah, I think I would, it would be nice. Just to sit there on all those white beaches, gazing out at the small orange star, flying over the misty jungles.\" \"You said it man.\" \"Yeah\" He stirred his chowder some more. Bits of meat and what looked to be like cabbage orbited his ladle. I drank some more ale and swirled its contents around. \"*What do you got swirling around in there big man?*\" I thought. \"Whats it like being a father now Ben?\" \"What?\" the question took me of guard \"Being a father, whats it like?\" \"Well, um, I don't know.\" \"Its okay, I don't mind, I asked anyway.\" He leaned forward in anticipation. I leaned back in thought. \"I guess. I'm not sure. My whole life I thought I had it all. My whole life I felt like I had everything, that I needed nothing else. I had a Job, great friends, a great station to live in, and an amazing girlfriend who loved me. T believe i thought that was it. That was going to be my life, now and forever. I guess I didn't realize at the time that all I really did was settled for what I had been given. I think back to my dad sometimes man, the things he did, the things I hated him for, the feeling I felt after he died. It changed, it all changed man. I guess I realize now why my father did the things he did because he loved me. He loved me a fucking lot man, especially after I put him through all the shit I did he still loved me, no matter what. I used to think that, that, I didn't want to be anything like him. But we have Jack in out lives and, and.\" \"And what?\" \"And now I don't want to be anything but my dad. I have this beautiful thing in my life now, and I'm going to love it and care for it until the end of time, because he's my son, my very own beautiful son, and I love him.\" \"I think I understand now.\" he said. He got up, pushed in his chair, and looked at me. \"Where are you going?\" \"Tanya wants to name him after you.\" He left. And as I finish writing this letter to you junior. You're fathers ashes are being spread on Esterik 9. He lives on through the white beaches and peaceful jungles of his new home. I hope that the day you read this letter you will be with him on those very beaches. After all, like father, like son.

Warframe seemed cool and was free so I hoped on in early beta, been here ever since What is something that's wonderful about life? Yes! I've been playing this game since forever and I've been really craving an open battlefield esqe mission. Seeing a fully formed Tenno army on an open battlefield is something that I've dreamed of. Who amongst your high school graduating class had the most successful life? That night, the night that it happened. We stared into the night sky. A lay man could not tell the difference between night and day however. I gazed into the bright starry sky and and features reflected my thoughts like a moonlit pool, blurry and disfigured. I gazed into the starry night and wondered, for the first time in a long while. The luminescent velvet pushed itself in and out of the sky like a labored breath. It's vast expanses of stars and nebula's all on display for a simple creature, such as myself, to sit and gawk at. I sat and meditated in the soft sand, the light of the stars would warm its velvet touch. I let the sand envelop me like an earthly blanket, buried and bathed in endless light as well as the softest sand. The others began to worry about me, they placed their blankets around me, wondering if I had gone mad. I simply stared into the night sky as they cared for me, I smiled. I could watch the expanse forever. How something so large could appear so small baffled my primate mind. Growing up as a child my mother often showed me books of art. I stared at them with similar awe as I did the sky that night. My favorite was Van Gogh. I'm sure you could guess my favorite painting. *Starry Night.* I remember thinking that the mountains Van Gogh painted looked like tree bark, and the longer I stared the more I felt like an ant, crawling to the tip top of the bark to taste the swirling clouds. The stars swirled like these clouds, still breathing in and out, with each exhale they began to grow farther away. My eyes were sore from absorbing it all. I spared my ears over stimulation by letting them fill with sand as I rest my head against the dunes. The swirling universe before me belched, quaked, and finally began to recede back into its corners. It was all rearranged and new. When the universe settled that night there were more stars in the sky than before, they had all been scattered into new locations. I wondered where Orion's belt was now. The night was coming to a close and I could hear a rustling in the distance behind me. A miserable cloaked figure shuffled its way across the sand. Wrapped in layers of blankets like a cocoon. I recognized the brow that hid behind the blankets as my own. My daughter sat beside me and gazed into the luminescence. She curled up and wrapped her gloved hand around the crook of my arm and asked if the others had made it. I told her I didn't know. We were the only ship that landed. After a long sigh and some labored breaths into my chest she rose from the sand and shuffled across the cold dessert and into the belly of the metal wreckage. I finally rose form my perch on the dune, moisture had gathered and cooled the sand below me. I playfully stepped in the footprints of my daughter as I made my way back to the crashed ship. Small lights beaconed out of its various orifices, like fireflies in the cool desert night. I shoved my sore and tired body into one of the man sized holes. One of our friends was cooking soup in a reclaimed communications dish. Our hungry eyes circled around the fire, and our shadows danced against the flickering yellow walls. I shut my eyes for the night. When I reopened them I could see the soft blue orange light of dusk emanating from an old head sized viewing port. I lazily crawled over the other sleeping bodies of leather and nylon in the dark. Outside I saw children look into the sky. I pulled myself out from our family wreckage den and heard the talk of others. I sat down and propped my back against the hull of the ship. Sand was still slithering down our half buried tiny entrance. The awake survivors talked about the center of the universe. How it all collapsed around us. How many more stars there were. I could hear one mention leaving the desert, his friend silenced his idea, we had lost all landing craft in the crash, and besides, we couldn't transport this many people.We were lucky enough that we even made it back to the earth before it all collapsed. He was right. We would bury ourselves like beetles in the machine tomb until our deaths. I blocked the rest of their talk from my ears by burying them in the sand again. And as my head rested on the dune, I turned it to see two children on top of the tallest dune, gazing at the infinite expanse of stars. There were pointing out the black shapes of empty sky. There were so many stars, Man would no longer make constellations, it would gaze at the blackness of the sky; and from this darkness, it would be guided.

Comments include as follows: When I ordered a salad \"Oh wait until you are eating for 2!!\" \"Shes just trying to look good\" to my mother when my mother complimented my weight loss at my wedding. My mother was FURIOUS and hasn't spoken to her since. \"I'm trying to look like THAT\" pointing to me at a family Christmas get together. It was so embarrassing and made her look insane. \"Wait until you have a baby!\" When I lost 10 pounds one summer for my job (cannot say what I do because it will give me away) Then she'll put down her and her daughter \"We only feed the girls in my family\" And what really bugged me is they came to my house last summer (this has since stopped) and my MIL pulled me a side and said \"Can you tell SIL she looks great? She lost 13 pounds.\" She gave my husband \"leftover\" chips cookies cakes and everything she knows I like when I was on a 3 day cleanse. Funny thing was I have IBS and was \"fasting\" on veggie juice to heal my stomach not loose weight. I didn't eat a bite of it but found it funny she assumed it was for vanity and not health. When I hit 153 last summer and she saw me she kept repeating \"You lost weight\" \"You lost so much weight\" and its literally the only thing she talks about. How do I make her stop obsessing about my weight? I've thought about saying \"If you worry less about my body and more about yours you would be happier.\" Or \"Why are you so obsessed with my body? Its f***ng creepy.\" And finally \"If you keep talking about my body, I'm leaving.\" And walking out of the family gathering. Thoughts? Shutting MIL down Family picnic is coming up. Last time I spoke to MIl I confronted her and she seems to have backed down However BILs fiance sent out invites to her bridal shower and I RSVP'd \"no\". How do I handle MILs badgering? She is very much \"Give me an explanation so I can argue with you about it insult you and passively aggressively tear you down about it.\" I have to see her in person for a large family gathering. The Nose in my 'Weight Loss' Has this been taken as a MIL name yet? Mine is quite nosey and prides herself in knowing things about you. Our family get together is quickly approaching and I've lost 7ish pounds due to my job that's mostly walking as well as eating right and regular exercising to self manage my anxiety. I look like I've lost twice that because I'm built like Rhonda Rousey (muscular). She wants to know what I have done to loose weight. Do I owe her a response? If I tell her what I'm doing she will turn it into a competition and I have no interest in competing with a post menopausal woman, especially not the one who [failed to] raise my husband. How should I respond to the \"'What have you been dooingggg's?\" DH insists these are complimentary but for the women out there who have bee through this we known better. I want to say \"Thinking of you and being unable to eat.\" But coming out the gate aggressive will backfire since her team of FMs will be there. Will \"Thank you for the compliment\" work? MIL sent GFIL to Mow My Grass This took place years ago about 8 months into my brand new marriage husband and I had new jobs, new schedules, a new home, and were still getting \"used to\" each other and were fighting a lot. I think MIL smelled blood. She would constantly bring up \"graaaandbabiezz\" and my husband and I would shoot her down. She did group tactics to \"shame us\" into kids at family reunions, run behind the other's back like a child to \"hint\" and when I would tell husband and he would call her to yell at her she would say \"subject280 is too sensitive I was joking about being at her delivery room and having GFIL film it!!\" So now we have FMGFIL. He is MILs father and is basically the Jedi who trained MIL. Hes also the biggest pain in the ads I've ever met. Helpless worthless waste of space. On top of this we had HIS mother GGMIL and his wife MILs mother GMIL. Bot were nasty bitches, codependent on GFIL. Around this time GGMIL and GMIL died 2 months apart. GFIL was naturally devastated and being new to the narc game I DID feel bad. Well MIL smelled the blood and approached husband and I in front of an audience with GFIL in tow and states \"He is just SO LONELY and LOVES to mow grass\" so husband and I agreed stupidly to let this FM into my home where he would bust up our lawn mower, our septic tank, and as soon as we were alone in the kitchen would hound me about grandbabies grandbabies grandbabies. Basically MIL had HIM coming to my house once a week on a work night hounding me for him. Stupid me allowed this for 2 summers. On one occasion he \"accidently\" let the dogs out and I had to chase them over 2 miles because they're hunting dogs. On another occasion he dug for information on my \"weight\" (my MILs obsession) and I finally told my husband \"When we purchase a new mower hes out\" and husband agreed. Now every holiday when I see this shriveled flying monkey he has the nerve to tell me with a CBF \"I miss mowing MY grass\". YOUR GRASS? Yours?!?!? You fucking prune...my theory is MIL wanted husband to move him in with us because we have a step in shower and live in a 1 story home. He was also a school teacher so in their heads \"if they have kids GFIL can be free childcare because they will neeeeed hiiimmm and he is faaaaaamily and sooo loonneeely\" The Time My Husband Flexed His Spine My MIL once tried to guilt us into a last minute party for her father, and we already had plans for the night. My husband responded \"We aren't coming\" To which she whined: \"But its GFIL's biiirrrrttthhhddaaay!\" To which husband replied:\"Oh, then we are DEFINITELY not coming.\" To say it was satisfying is an understatement. The Nose At The Bridal Shower This happened 3 years ago when I first got married. I thought this was the place to unpack it. So I did not WANT a bridal shower. MySometimesNo mother decides I was having one. She, her best friend who is like an aunt to me/mother of MY best friend, my sister and even my brother worked and had food done/games planned in 2 days. My mother calls me and states \"Your MIL keeps texting me 3 times a day asking to help and won't take \"we have it all done\" for an answer. What the  #247;* #247;* #215; do I do?\" Stupid me says \"Ask her to make a dish so she shuts up.\" MIL invites herself to my mothers house to arrange her dish. Of course immediately starts rearranging things and my mom has to tell her several times \"NO\" My parents called me. My Dad who is stoic and usually silent was like \"This woman is a bitch.\" The day of my bridal shower MIL invites GFIL \"to sit in the back room\" since he droce GMIL and GreatGMIL. MIL proceeds to try to make it a day for GreatMIL to get the attention off of me. My friends and family are there all happy for me. MIL is jealous. CBF the whole day. My mothers friend and I do BeachBody workouts and we have both been obease in the past. We were taking about the latest program and my MIL says *to my mothers face* \"Oh...LaneAnie is just in 'bride mode'.\" My mom had watched me struggle with my weight my whole life. My mom gives a speech. Halfway through a teary eyed part my MIL stands up, barks over my mom \"We love LaneAnie too.\" My mom and her friend were speechlessly pissed. GMIL kept mistaking me for \"my twin sister\" I dont HAVE a twin guys!! Gift opening time. MIL snatches every open gift out of my hands to inspect it despite the fact my friend is keeping track of the gift/who sent it. I got a check, guys, she ripped it out of my hands to see how much her husbands realtive had given me/her son! At the end my moms other friend pulls me aside and says \"subject280...What the fuck is wrong with your MIL?\" Reports came back from guests that they were extremely uncomfortable with the way she acted the whole time. And of COURSE weight obsessed sister in law \"Couldn't get the day off of work.\" To bother to come. I strongly suspect she was mad because H and I had been engaged and her long time boyfriend was dragging his feet. My mother says \"When its time for a baby shower MIL isnt welcome.\" MILs Side Get Together Date was set. All of The Boss's nosey flying monkeys are assembled. \"When are you having kids?\" Is all these assholes ask me about.( I wanted to edit this and say I think MIL coaches them to do this. Last year they made a big deal about an old high chair and in front of every one asked loudly if WE wanted it.) My canned responses are \"MIL said it would make me fat so I'm afraid to.\" (Because she has baby rabies this would throw it back in her face) \"When people stop asking.\"(this opens me up to \"we haven't asked where are the kids\" questions) \"That's a strange thing to ask....are you saying I LOOK pregnant? You are SO RUDE!\" (This makes me look insane which furthers MILs narrative) Or I could flip the script. Get them to tell me about their pregnancies and then as they're talking cut them off and say \"Thats nice\" and walk away. MIL in Mauve So...how about \"you will be 3rd to know...after Husband and MY mom know.\" Success Its ALL about control to these people. No SS number no high school diploma no photo ID no record of you and you cant leave. New Daughters I see it as you did your husband a favor by reminding HIM to do something vs doing something nice for your MIL. After all you are his wife.

            "subject3301***SEPARADOR***Just found out what I do when I feel anxious is not normal. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Are you saying that you have lines that can be either \"2_label2_1\" or \"2_label2_2\", and that you want to split them by the last character? In that case you could do something like this... val Array(one,two) = scala.io.Source.fromFile(filename).getLines.groupBy(x = gt; -x(x.length-1)).values.toArray Where one is an Array of the lines that end in one and two the lines that end in two. Probably not the best way but if your file is relatively short then this should work well enough.\n",
            "subject3357***SEPARADOR***19 and getting an abortion soon. Looking for comfort/advice I #8217;m a 19 year old girl and I #8217;ve been dating my boyfriend (18) since March and we have a great relationship. I never thought I would get pregnant this soon, I always hoped to get pregnant after I got married. We didn #8217;t use birth control but he did always pull out. My periods are irregular so when my period was a few days late I wasn #8217;t too worried but still took a test when I was 4 days late (I took the test on November 7th). When I saw that the test was positive, I was in complete shock, I couldn #8217;t believe it. My boyfriend and I have always talked about what would happen if I accidentally got pregnant and we would most likely go through with an abortion, but there was still a possibly that I would keep it. But as soon as I saw the positive test, I immediately knew that I was going to have an abortion. My boyfriend is extremely supportive and let me choose what I wanted to do. Him and I are both in school and living with our parents and both our parents are very religious and we don #8217;t know what would happen if they knew I was pregnant at 19 or if I had an abortion. We are not in any way ready for a baby right now. Anyways, my boyfriend called a hospital near us that serviced abortions and I talked to a lady that scheduled an appointment on November 22nd (that was the soonest opening). She said I would have an ultrasound, get my blood drawn and other tests. I have been researching whether a medical abortion or surgical abortion would be best but I #8217;m still not sure which would be better. My LPM is October 8th, but I conceived around October 17th-23rd, so I #8217;m technically around 3 weeks. For a little backstory, I #8217;m an extremely emotional and sensitive person, so this is hitting me very hard. I don #8217;t want to have a baby right now but I also don #8217;t want to have an abortion. In class yesterday, I couldn #8217;t stop tearing up and wiping tears away. I know this is going to cause me a lot of pain and grief. I will probably feel guilt for the rest of my life. In conclusion, this is very difficult for me to handle but I know I have to do what #8217;s best for my boyfriend and I #8217;s lives and careers, I also would want my baby to be raised in the best environment possible. If anyone could offer some comfort and assurance to me, I would really appreciate it. Edit: YES I knew that pulling out wasn #8217;t a sufficient form of birth control, I had plans to get an iud very soon. Also, anyone who is not planning on getting pregnant would be shocked as well to see a positive pregnancy test. Please do not comment negativity, I know what I did and I don #8217;t need negativity at this time. Positive surgical abortion experience at 8 weeks Thank you I hope so too I just want to feel better Thank you Pain during sex and cramps and bleeding every day with copper iud I planned on getting an iud but the clinic never called me back for an appointment, I was going to go this past week. Literally anyone who isn #8217;t planning to get pregnant would be shocked to find out that they were pregnant. Fuck out of here Am I the only one who tracks their  #8220;pregnancy #8221; with apps and online? I am thankful that I have an abortion service near me, I #8217;m also glad that I #8217;m in Canada so I don #8217;t have to pay for it. I #8217;m definitely going to try and go to a councillor after this is done with. Thank you\n",

            "subject4392***SEPARADOR***I now know who was the inspiration to Ronaldo's Golden Shoe speech Yes that is completely normal! I've had ocd for the last 7 years and comparing my rituals than and now, they're completely different. Most of them still based on counting but very different. I know it's strange because when you have a compulsion you think you'll never get rid of it...but sometimes it happens which can be good or not, because sometimes you just replace for other tic... (at least in my case). Wish you the best (: Does anyone else sometimes \"forget\" why you're doing your compulsions? When I go travelling my ocd gets really, really worse. Last week I was supposed to go on a trip but I got so anxious, I was thinking about all the things that could kill me on that trip for every second I was not sleeping, and my compulsions were on the edge. I touched everything, counted non stop, I couldn't do anything but stay still on the couch crying. So I decided not go on the trip. I also decided to see a psychologist for the first time in 7 years battling with ocd. The suddenly, when I decided not to do something that made me really anxious, my obsessions almost disappear. And I still do a lot of compulsions, counting and touching, but I'm not thinking why I'm doing them, and causes me much less anxiety. I know this is probably just a phase were I'm less nervous and therefore better...but has this happen to anyone? Also, I'm afraid now my psychologist thinks this is nothing serious...but it is... Thank you! Can't stop counting subtitles, words and lines from books Yes!! For example the sound of someone chewing gum kills me but just to see the motion of the mouth makes me wanna punch myself. That also happens for example with someone bitting their nails, I can't stand not only the sound but also the image. And there are many other visual triggers for me...it's great Obsessions with spirits/ paranormal stuff? One of my compulsions is counting and in the past weeks it has been almost impossible for me to watch a movie or read a book. I start counting without even noticing and than I can not stop until I reach a certain number (which is usual big...). I now avoid doing this things since it can become quite unbearable. Anyone else?\n"

            "subject1018***SEPARADOR***If only my husband would let me, I have myoclonus and was trying to train my own dog. Chat room Are there any chat rooms out there for people in the US who are having suicidal thoughts or self harm thoughts, to talk to others in the same head space? Not a help line chat or anything like that. I was just wondering the same thing. Why are we always staying alive for other people? Afraid to take the leap for fear of what will happen to others 15 years of friendship, 15 years of fighting to stay alive, 1 divorce, 1 ending My meds have been making me suicidal again, although it #8217;s not really again if it never went away. Being left alone after being so close to someone and even married to them is my breaking point. When the cutting doesn #8217;t help anymore, it #8217;s time to find the right pill combination. I was thinking the same thing as my husband said he wanted a divorce. There #8217;s a girl who calls me mom and every day I get a text saying #8220;mommy please don #8217;t leave me, you promised #8221;. It kills me and breaks my heart. How will your daughter go on without you? What have you done to keep going? You are so young with so much life left to live. There has to be someone who will miss you. Why are you in danger? One of the people I cared about was taken away from me today. The last two weeks have been hell and just getting worse What to do when there is nothing left? In the past two weeks I have lost my husband who wants divorce, best friend of 14 years (husband), my job and today a 15 yr old that I was I guess #8220;mentoring #8221;. She called me mom and pushed me to fight the same as I pushed her to fight. She got baker acted last night and as of what her dad said today I will never see or hear from her again. My doctors see my medication and want to change it, but the last attempt at that left me in an even worse place. I #8217;m massively depressed and my anxiety is through the roof. I have family who are trying to be supportive and friends trying to be supportive. But when I face the facts that I will likely have to sell my horse (my best form of therapy), I can #8217;t really care for my dogs. I don #8217;t want to care for myself. I feel like a waste of human resources and a drain on the economy. There is nothing left to really live for, so why bother. I just can #8217;t seem to find the right mixture even though I try almost nightly. I get how you feel. I #8217;m a burden on my friends, family and soon to be ex husband. I lost my job and can #8217;t afford to take of my animals let alone get through a divorce and I #8217;m too depressed to do anything about it. People always say #8220;you #8217;re not a burden #8221; but it doesn #8217;t change the feeling. Maybe talk to your grandma and tell her how you are feeling now. I #8217;m pretty sure she wouldn #8217;t want you to kill yourself. Because we actually care about the people we leave behind. And the body doesn #8217;t actually want to die. You and me both, sadly I don #8217;t even think we can any disability. Depression and ocd are hard. But it seems like ending it all is even harder. Sadly there will be guilt no matter what you do. Guilt for breaking up, or guilt left after you #8217;re gone. Is it life or the severe depression I #8217;ve been suicidal for years now, I #8217;ve also been cutting for years to stop from crying or to calm myself down. Lately with my life falling apart I #8217;m back to being extremely suicidal again. I say I #8217;m staying for my mom or my friends. But now I wonder am I just too scared to do it? Am I to scared it won #8217;t work and I #8217;ll get baker acted? I #8217;m I too scared it will work and worrying about the people and animals left behind. Is this just another phase of the depression being unbearable? The anxiety doesn #8217;t help at all either, and to top it off psychiatrist are wanting to change my meds at the worst possible time. I don #8217;t care the Benzodiazepines cause Alzheimer #8217;s, it #8217;s only a problem if I live long enough to experience it. My friend and I talk and joke about it bc what else can you really do. So every day I fight not to take the pills at night or during the day. Not to drive my car somewhere and take the forever nap. I keep questioning myself so maybe I #8217;m not #8220;suicidal #8221; but I definitely don #8217;t want to be here and my first thought every morning is #8220;shit I #8217;m still alive #8221;. You #8217;re far from alone. It has a weird calming affect that #8217;s hard to explain to those who don #8217;t get it.\n",
            "subject1080***SEPARADOR***Do you live in Nigeria? Making drama for 7 bucks, at least you didn't lose really big amounts like most people. pm link please My parents are as retarded dude. One time I was quarelling with my dad and out of nothing he called the cops and told them that I used some type of drug. Another day I woke up sick and my fucking racist doctor told my parents to have me tested on drugs! Just because I didn't feel good! Drinking the dope?? That last sentence sent me back in time ... I feel you bro :( Hope you'll never end up getting ripped or robbed man, I have never seen such an amount of money in my life because I can't find any customers... Old one from 2016 Suffering from depression I fucking hate my phone so much but if I destroy it my parents won't be able to contact me anymore and since I have pretty bad anxiety everytime somebody asks me if I have any type of social media it really makes me afraid. There's a girl in my class that says she has a crush on me but I don't fucking believe her. She never pays attention to me, never sends me any messages and doesn't seem to care at all. I think she's doing it because she needs emotional support, and that when she's stable again she will kick me out of her life. After having stopped my oversensivity with substances I can assure you that I think it's better for me like this. I gave up on everything and I don't expect anything out of life. I'm completely destroyed, I can't handle people touching me anymore. Be like me, stay home all day. No pain, no feelings. Man ... what an amazing story ... I feel horribly sorry for you ... I think I'm glad that nobody ever got to do the same thing to me when I read this. Is snorting meth once worth it?  I'm thinking about trying meth once in my life but there are a million people saying that it's the most addictive thing ever, that the comedowns are hell and that it will permanently damage your brain. This can't be true right? Lmao Planning on doing the same but I've got a baggie of fucking strong pure synthetic and I don't wanna die. Goodbye dude, hope you have a painless death. Just another worthless day passing by ...  Am I the only one experiencing this? You wake up in the morning after an amazing dream, you think for a second where you are and then you realize you're in your bedroom and not dead yet, and it's gonna be another fucking boring day. You go to school and see those people again that pretend to be your friends, they ask you how you are and you just answer 'fine' like always. When you finally come home you feel tired and empty and you haven't been paying attention to a single lesson. You'll try to eat something nice to feel better, but it doesn't help, you try going outside, but you have no one to join you, you want to study for your future, but you're constantly telling yourself that it's pointless, you want to be busy with your hobbies, but you have no motivation and feel guilty for everything you do. I've been like this for freaking months and even though I visit the psychiatrist frequently those conversations with her only make me feel worse and anxious. I also feel like depression killed half of my braincells because lately I'm having a hard time remembering people's name and shit. If I don't get help soon I'm sure that it'll be the fucking end for me. Oh, well I always seem to come close to suicide whenever life is being a bitch again but lately I've been locking myself up for my own safety so no worries. Just when I thought that someone was finally going to escape from the curse called life. My friends indeed hate me for using drugs and damn I never get invited to parties ... Can't you add any sort of scent to make it taste better? I fucking hate my parents too man, they're one of the main reasons that I'm depressed as shit and only see evil inside of me. I always have to get the best grades, be better than others and they don't fucking leave me alone. And when you ask them why they're doing this they'll respond with 'it's for your own good'. No, stop. Goodbye my friend, hope we will meet one day when this shitty world comes to its end. If you wanna experience death, try psychedelics to make sure you won't regret it. I smoked synthetic weed last month and it sent me to hell. I didn't regret anything and even if it hurt alot I was glad that I wasn't alive anymore. Just a few hours later I woke up and felt like I had lost something. I had a girlfriend and it made me anxious as fuck, constantly worrying that I'm not enough, jealous at everyone that talks to her and in the end I only hurt myself. Don't try it please, it's fine like this. Bye my dude, hope you will get what you wished for. Yes, but I'm not going to commit suicide, I prefer being a life long drug addict instead of killing myself. Re: depression memes  Am I the only person that wants to smash his skull against the wall when he sees another shitty meme about depression or anxiety? I bet that 99% of the people that consider these as funny are faking their depression. Most of the time they don't even make any sense and are very bland. I don't understand how people can think that memes about something they're suffering from everyday can be funny. Showers used to make my day better now they only cause me headaches. How to study when you're hopeless  I'm having finals tomorrow, but after 5 minutes looking at my book I start staring for hours at the wall and I end up in thought loops. I really don't want to fail my finals but I know really good that studying is worthless if I'll end up killing myself anyway. I used to watch alot of depression memes too in the past but I've realized that memes itself are immature and really stupid. Nothing can really make me smile anymore when I'm on my own. Drinking water makes you less depressed.  If you ever looked up for tips and tricks to overcome depression, you'll most likely find people saying drink alot of of water and do yoga. I tried about a gallon of water everyday (4 liters) but I didn't fucking change anything. It only reduced my brain fog but other than that there was no difference. I'm not going to try yoga because doing sports make me very uncomfortable and I can't imagine how it would make me feel better. Lmaoo selfharm.pics isn't working?  Tried to sign up but can't receive confirmation email I really want to access the site but I can't. Beauty in a nutshell. Weird dream.  Last night I was scrolling through Instagram and a friend of mine was chilling with my ex-crush. 1.5 years ago I fell in love with her but she said that she didn't want to be with me anymore because I was loving her way too much. She also switched schools so I saw her less often. Months passed and I did all kinds of stupid shit for her to convince her to be with me, but she didn't accept anything, not even the silver ring I gave her (she told me that she threw it away). Around may 2018 I stopped contacting her and checking on her and minded my own business, but she was somehow always stuck in my head. When I encouraged myself to think of something positive, it was always her, even when I didn't love her anymore. But it didn't make me feel good, it filled me with guilt and sadness. So yesterday when I saw a picture of her I was first disgusted, but when I went to sleep later, I had a really weird dream. We were on a sort of playground. i saw her at the slide and first she looked away, but for some reason 2 of my cousins were there as well (they knew that I loved this girl and they made fun of me). I was talking first with my 2 cousins and I dropped a few jokes, and all of them started laughing. That's when I started to talk with my crush again, and she wasn't ignoring me, but I don't remember what we were talking again, because I suddenly woke up, disappointed that I didn't die in my sleep. Yeah but I always get thin scars that you can't really see I wonder how people get these thick red/purple scars.\n",
            "subject115***SEPARADOR***I had weird surrealistic dream once about a hospital but the doctors jobs were to bring Doritos to the patients. So they would run around the corridors with bags of doritos. It also had a voiceover like an ad and very bright colours. It bought me anti-depressants Never go to the bathroom again. Why was 5 afraid of 6? Because 6 was convicted of the raping and murder of 124 children. I think his throat cancer spreads with the music. A knife I only need the gun to shoot up my school. I get super overstimulated by touch and was always paranoid of tickles to the point where I would burst in tears if someone wiggled their fingers next to me. I'm allergic to bullets. Use to punch myself as punishment. Then I scratched scabs. Then I scratched my skin without scabs until it bled. And then one day I took a kitchen knife and went over and over my skin until it hurt enough. (The blade was hella dull)\n",

            "subject1222***SEPARADOR***Ok I'm 18. 5o talk? I just wanna die I've realized there is no way I can life the way I want to and that I'm worthless. There's no point. I know there's NO WAY I can live the rest of my life the way I want to. I'll never amount to anything in the future. I've just wasted my parents money. I'm disappointed in myself. I'm pathetic. Thank you but I wanna die quickly and painlessly that's how pathetic I am I don't have the guts to hang myself I tried sticking my head in a plastic bag to suffocate but that didn't work it just gets so scary that ur body subconsciously gets out of it like my body acted on it's own. I don't know what else to do. I have no future I'll just end up disappointing everyone and myself if I continue to live like this so it's better to just die. It just won't get better I've realized that life is just an endless grind. I thought it would be work hard in high school and relax in college but it's not. It's work hard in college then work hard getting a job then work hard in the job I don't wanna live like that but if I don't live like that I'll be worthless. I'm just worried what'll happen to my parents if I do decide to kill myself they'll start blaming each other and shit and I wanna die quickly and painlessly those are the only 2 things stopping me right now Yeah exactly I'm really worried about my family too but if it gets too certain point then I'll have to jump right now I can only jump from 35-40 feet but I don't know if that'll do it but idk if that'll work. K I'll try to wait till college starts but if it gets bad then I've decided how I'mma do it I'll do it late at night wear an old tight shirt and stuff some glasses in the shirt's chest area landing chest first should be easy if the fall doesn't kill me then the blood loss from the lacerations due to the shattered glass definitely will.

I tried cutting myself a few days ago it was kinda fun but not really thrilling. I don't know. I just hate the person I am right now. Everytime I see myself in the mirror or in a picture I'm just disappointed and angry. I hate everything I do. I don't know why I'm like but I wish I was different.

I hate the way I look I hate my voice I hate the way I speak I hate the way I interact with people. I've always hated myself but lately I'm realizing how pathetic I actually am and now I just love punching walls. I started a month ago. I love the rush I get while punching and I love the pain I feel after. I love seeing bruises and blood and I love the scars that come after. A couple days ago I like dislocated my tendon. I loved that too it was like a new injury. I'm a college student everyone asks what happened to your hand I just lie to them it's not like they care anyway. I wanna get hurt really bad but then I'll get caught. I tried cutting myself between 2 knuckles but it was just painful. There was no satisfaction so I'ma stick to punching walls.

Does the cpu automatically overclock itself with default bios settings? I am not currently interested in OCing the 2700x with the stock fan. with default bios settings my CPU #8217;s EDC spikes to red during idle. is that normal? Is it normal for the VDDCR to be 1.4+ consistently? I #8217;ve seen it hit 1.5 occasionally on stock bios settings. My cpu stock fan #8217;s speeds whirr and tone themselves down pretty quickly whenever I #8217;m idle or browsing through the bios. it is pretty annoying. is that a normal occurrence of the processor? would it be worth investing in a aio cooler? i am using the latest bios update and my chipset drivers are up to date as well. Thank you for your patience as I try and wrap my head around this thing! okay. thanks! ahh, I see. Out of curiosity, what is exceptional cooling by your definition? how much lower temps are you averaging with one? i tend to get high temps with it on. Buuut I will surely test it out if I can get better cooling for it someday so I don #8217;t cook it haha. ahhh I see. thanks! Anyone wanna play pc ow  :D?

He is not a stable man. In January my mother attempted suicide. I do not want to go into detail but I will say I was the one who found her and called. The night before my moms suicide attempt I was arguing with her because I did not want my little sisters to move in with hoover. I was afraid of their safety and I did not want to risk them going through any sort of misery because of this clearly unstable man my unstable mother loves. I have been struggling with accepting that reality is real. my mother goes on charades of saying how much she hates him to saying how much she needs him in her life. this man has a calendar and dishes out time for her. I can say so fucking much about this man that just resonates an awful feeling within me. he had me and my sisters sit and listen to him like he was a drill sergeant essentially telling us it was his way or you #8217;re never seeing your mom again. I was pissed, and I still am extremely pissed with how controlling this man is. Im sorry if this all makes no sense. I am beyond baffled and it hurts me so much that it #8217;s hard to write out coherently. He will not go. all he does is have time because the state provides for him because of his ptsd. whenever my mom tries breaking up with him he sends her documentary length film episodes of texts and emails and calls her on different phones when she blocks him. it feels like there is no escape. He blackmails her with legal documents and sends her pictures of documents filled out against her. I am so crushed, I don #8217;t know what to do. can I join?? was i supposed to laff jokes on u i just woke up at 5pm and did nothing oh cool. thanks! i feel like I am running out of #171; #160;distractions #160; #187; or whatever you call them in this post. just a tiredness and not much making me happy anymore. its incredibly sedative i love to bottle up my feelings and facing them just makes me want to run away from them. whY is the world ending soon? no i havent heard :/ i dont see meaning in life or things in general so I don #8217;t bother to watch the news lol. that all sounds thrilling, glad I was born in this universe hey, wanna talk? which is why I don #8217;t understand why it #8217;s a big deal now. Global warming has been around for awhile now. we #8217;re all going to die someday. why stress over the inevitable destruction of mankind? not like many of us have or have had a say. i dunno dude. I watched my mom seize in her bed ODing off of countless pills. maybe it would be easier to just die when the planets gone to shit. im a 3.9k hitscan player, but im 19 :( ahh I gotcha! I have a bunch of accounts because I like to onetrick and flex, so feel free to add #65351; #65353; #65362; #65356;#1809 and CHIDORI#31131 im pretty self destructive too. wanna talk more about it? can they stop things don #8217;t feel real  ive been struggling with life feeling unreal ever since i saved my mom from her suicide attempt. a few days earlier I watched my grandfather pass away as well and my mother attempted suicide two days after his funeral. It was pretty rough for me as the oldest of four. I #8217;ve always struggled with mental health problems like anxiety / panic disorder and I am a massive insomniac. i feel incredibly slow and careless and I can #8217;t be bothered to do shit about it especially since things don #8217;t feel real and I feel like I #8217;m in some other world. nothing makes sense to me. i like to sleep away life, but I #8217;m also an insomniac so it #8217;s pretty ruff that honestly makes a lot of sense. like you just become so unbothered that you cant even be bothered to plan a suicide are Your temps consistent without PBO? to be honest your best bet is to stay away from him. try and not agitate him, it is in your best interest and for the sake of your sanity. get an aio if you want significant improvements, I had used the wraith prism and it #8217;s really trashy honestly. I don #8217;t think people treat mental health like breast cancer awareness at all. just with many communities mental health is PRETTY taboo actually. no one wants to admit there #8217;s something wrong with them, lots of people go without the help they need because they don #8217;t want to be looked down upon or treated differently by some individuals. everyone to some degree wants to be normal and to be accepted. there is slowly a culture shift on acceptance happening, but its a slow process yknow? I was mostly speaking from experience and from how the people around me act towards mental health. lol wait a year I still think you should wait especially if you live with ur parents lol, people slip with sex toys all the time and it is from my friends experiences the most awkward shit haha explain I used to use 7cups and I #8217;ve never had a good listener from there. they end up talking about their life stories and I end up being a therapist for them. its not what I came there for and it #8217;s a waste of my time. i told my mom I was suicidal and she told me #8220;join the club #8221; lmfao this has been pretty hard for me to deal with, especially since I had social anxiety prior and whenever I try and crawl myself out of that sort of mindset I have this innate fear of people and allowing myself to be vulnerable so I just want to crawl back into it I don #8217;t want to feel anymore  I hate this soul crushing pain and hopelessness and I want it to leave my head. I #8217;ve been desperate trying to get into hobbies and things but nothing has eased my mind or changed the way i feel, if anything it #8217;s exacerbated it. i want it to leave so badly and it scares me. I #8217;ve never understood those types of fetishes lil puppy I #8217;m not sure. she was my old neighbors dog aussie snoot plat is extra interesting. nope, nice try communist. it almost looks like the bear minimum specs. you won #8217;t have a super enjoyable time but it should run. I #8217;d try flushing your dns. see if it puts u back to west. if not then welcome to the best coast bitch. Route 66 sucks I #8217;m curious, have you optimized your pc or the game at all? see if you can go back to the nvidia drigers from 411.70. Quick play has a mmr system so technically you are facing people your own rank. I #8217;m not going to lie I got myself drunknvecause I loved the way it makes me feele instead ofb that, butj I #8217;ll try thnk u Try reverting the graphics driver. to like version 411.70 You #8217;re trying to isolate yourself so no one gets hurt when u decide on milking yourself. I am the same way, please talk to me. Killing*** didn #8217;t realize what u had,sirry I get you. I just drink, I don #8217;t do anything else because alcohols the only thing in the house I have easy access to. its easy to get addicted to things when your heads fucked. this morning I woke up feeling the same shitty way I felt when I fell asleep so I just ended up drinking it away. I don #8217;t have access to therapy or proper meds. I hate how I push away my friends and girlfriend and I don #8217;t know how they #8217;re still here and what it will take for them to just leave so I can disappear quietly without any reciprocation. It feels terrible, I don #8217;t know if it gets better. but I wanted you to know that you aren #8217;t alone with these feelings and if you ever want to talk about shit more ill listen. sure. I detach from everything and just blast music and lay in bed. i get uneasy and I just want to not exist anymore. that #8217;s not true lol she is my life tbh my babye I am convinced my drivers are messing it up as well, @___@ Whats ur OC? cuddley babey lots of people cheat to gm, then get banned. sometimes it takes awhile babye table top boye have u disabled it in the device manager? your system should not search for drivers if its unavailable. just curious because sometimes people just disable it in the sound panel and not the device manager and it doesn #8217;t always stop it. deer leggys soft could be a mental breakdown?? sleepy bean alright, let me know! hey, try reverting your nvidia drivers. to 411.70 Soggy boye lol honestly I #8217;d be surprised if they don #8217;t take advantage of this. atleast give Hammond a soccer ball skin as well. you don #8217;t have to be mechanically skilled to climb in overwatch, it is a team based game. if they excel at something else like gamesense and shotcalling they should do jus fine. so long as they aren #8217;t on aim intensive hero #8217;s. I #8217;ve seen many people succeed though. lol depends, if you #8217;re tilted to the point of no return take a break :,) otherwise you might perform terribly. yeah! it counts the game as completed and gives you the rank you #8217;d have gotten if you lost the final placement even if u come back. pretty interesting lmao No if u win, but if you loose games in the lower elo yes. depends on how good u are at doom ngl i mean besides the noise i kinda see where ur coming from but it personally doesn #8217;t bother me that the animations are similar. its really easy to tell when an orisa dropped her bongo and that it #8217;s coming from the bongo. I feel like there would be too much visual clutter if orisa had a distinct animation for the ui itself especially if you #8217;d get boosted by a mercy as well. sometimes consistency for similar actions is okay. ive seen people leave in any rank, I don #8217;t think there #8217;s a direct correlation with rank and dnf statistics UNLESS someone is intentionally deranking. I mean maybe people get frustrated when they can #8217;t aim or something while they try and force overwatch to run on their toaster, otherwise I #8217;m not really seeing it. tbh with you I don #8217;t really notice much of a difference player mentality wise bronze thru low plat. I just wouldn #8217;t sweat about it and perform as best as you can. might as well since you can only sweettalk your teammates to success only so much haha. LMAO UR DIRTY a colorful scribble thoughts on medication as a form of help?  My mental health has become pretty destructive to my daily life and I am pretty self destructive in general. i am not medicated but I am diagnosed. would it be worth trying to take meds for my head? my mother has always been pretty anti-medication which is why I #8217;ve always been weary, but i am sort of at this #8220;fuck it #8221; mindset at this point to try anything I haven #8217;t. storing it for later :) table top snow eatin were u lagging? hows your internet connection? NZ servers might be down, which is why it #8217;s forcing u on US I get that, but it sounds like this happens a lot to you. if that #8217;s the case, has it only been happening recently or? o ok doomfist rendering device lost is on your end. try reverting nvidia drivers if u have a nvidia gpu to 411.70 and prior or make sure all ur shits updated. I #8217;d stop playing come first of all, you know your risking games for not only you but your teammates as well. try fresh installing maybe? dog comes home from vet. sees things in the wall wait what? I #8217;m confused. how is jojo a bad thing? please explain more if you can. there should be an option to disable voice in icue. maybe it #8217;s in the same spot for firmware updates if you remember where that is, i haven #8217;t used it in awhile since my void pro broke but I strongly remember being able to disable it. I feel that, I used to not like darling in the franxx because someone I don #8217;t like was obsessed with zerotwo. I watched it, stopped associating her with it and my life is much easier because I tried my hardest to stop associating her with it and to not let her inadvertently affect me. i know it #8217;s hard to move on from someone who hurt you especially when things they like reminisce in shows and whatever. shows usually don #8217;t reflect on people #8217;s behaviors, I promise jojo won #8217;t make people bad friends to you like that one dude. happy grass boy no. be a battle mercy. i can send u many of my potgs from diamond+ battlemercying wait what? Did u record it? wtf orange I didn #8217;t read the other comments I #8217;m sorry LMAO LMAOOOO I never said I lost those games nice essay but, I am a gm dps player and I battle mercy on smurfs whenever I want to because its fun and it would be silly not to encourage it. I #8217;m not saying do it all the time silly, take it with a grain of salt all you want lol it doesn #8217;t really matter too deeply to me. hopeless  I keep relapsing pretty badly and it just gets worse and worse each time. I hate my head more than anything in the world and I #8217;m sick of how self destructive I am. I #8217;ve ruined so many opportunities mostly because of my mental health and it just builds up man I don #8217;t do anything with my life other than blast music and occasionally text friends and sleep and I #8217;m hardly motivated to take care of myself anymore. bork I #8217;m so sick of panic attacks.  I #8217;ve had a lot of them and over the years and they #8217;ve gotten different. I didn #8217;t notice them first as panic attacks and I thought I actually had been clean for a month or two because I was used to them appearing in different ways in the past. but I hate the absolutely overwhelming nature of them. I hate having one at night because I still feel those feelings of dread and deep anxieties when I wake up in the morning sometimes and sleeping it off doesn #8217;t cut it. I just want it all to end. same here, I can #8217;t even drive period. I #8217;m 19, I #8217;ve never gotten my license. they are insanely debilitating and I wish I was normal more often than I can count so I could have done the things I enjoy. I don #8217;t think you #8217;ll get much internet points for this I #8217;ve started talking my dog out for walks in the mornings  its a little thing, but it #8217;s helped my head a little bit. I have a hard time motivating myself to do pretty much anything, normally I freeze up pretty badly and give up and I spend a lot of my time just laying in bed or sleeping. but today and yesterday I was able to get myself to walk my dog across the field from my house and it felt really nice. hard time opening up  I am a perfectionist and it drills me how imperfect I am. Its hard for me to let myself be vulnerable and talk about the #8220;imperfections #8221; of my head like my depression without fear of how they #8217;d treat me any differently. It #8217;s genuinely pretty scary to me. I don #8217;t think you should leave her if you guys both love each other as much as you say. it looks like she is actively making an effort for the better, and that she is in a rough spot right now. getting therapy in itself can be very hard for people to deal with. i want you to know that I gave my mother space and she attempted to kill herself in that short time period of me thinking backing away would have benefited her more than not. I am an unstable person as well, the least you want to do is leave and I realize that now. space isn #8217;t a bad thing, but being there constantly could be overwhelming to her if that #8217;s what you guys are thinking. if you back away for a bit make sure to let her know that you #8217;re still there if she needs you, even if it #8217;s just a little text it can really go a long way. oh AAAAAAA  AAAAaaaAaaaaaaaaaaaa churropractor sometimes bad internet drivers will cause this. try reinstalling them Oh yeah man. its pretty wrenching. I cant even open up to my romantic partner about it right now without shying away, I never could properly with a therapist and it just leaves me feeling very frustrated and sort of helpless. I know it sounds a little contradictory but I sort of freeze up and cower away from the idea of letting them know completely. vulnerability scares me like a plague. I used to lie to one of my therapists, say I was participating in hobbies and such just because I never wanted to admit that I lost interest in most things for a long time now. it took me such a long time to open up to her about pretty much most things. Sometimes it #8217;s easier to talk to strangers about it, but a therapist becomes a sort of acquaintance. exactly, I don #8217;t want to bring her down with me either. I know I #8217;m a lot to take in. sometimes I #8217;ve said some things here and there, but it #8217;s still incredibly hard to not want to emotionally run away from it all. thank you though. for what it #8217;s worth I #8217;m going to try and get a professional to help me again, you #8217;ve opened my eyes a little. my mom constantly puts herself through terrible boyfriends who always abuse her. I #8217;ve had to help her through all of the shit I #8217;ve lived to see her go through like a little pocket therapist, including her suicide attempts. I want to know why too. Facebooks media servers are down right now. me u should have gotten a #8220;you tried #8221; or an #8220;attempt was made #8221; achievement do you have a ssd? Hdds tend to load pretty slowly from my experience. I don #8217;t think there #8217;s much you can do about load in time in that regard with a laptop. facebook and instagram are run by the same company. if facebooks servers are down then so are instagrams. where did u end the season before? sometimes it depends on the time of day. how many people are on. no, season 11 or whatever you said. did u play any games after you placed? that #8217;s why, it doesn #8217;t place you based off of where you placed initially. it places you based off of where you ended the last time you played comp. man I love me some long necked chicane god I want some of those back. I used to do it because my head was so fucked up and I just wanted to feel something. TWO!!! wasp r nasty tasting no its just wasp. I refuse to believe there is more than one I like to say my twin sisters dog is mine because I take care of her during the day when my sister works night shifts haha, but I think it would be very good to have my own dog someday. that means I have to work for it, and it sort of gives me a spark of motivation but I can never usually ride it through it. I never noticed how much dogs helped people emotionally before its fair to feel indifferent about them, people die. that #8217;s just how life works. you fucked up dude. Apologize. you should! trust me. :) it #8217;s worth it. guys how many times do i have to tell you. theres only one wasp. oh no  I want to curl up n a little ball of non-existence saaameeeeeee no one to party with, so I #8217;m on the Internet lol samme im 19 too its pretty killer :7 I was mute for many years and I had terrible panic attacks that left me really avoiding people for a long time, but it gets pretty lonely I am curious  sorry if this is the wrong place for this, but why doesn #8217;t the United States pick a president who is moderate? why do they have to pick sides? In theory wouldn #8217;t it be better to pick a candidate that both sides could agree on and keeps both sides in mind when making decisions? Or is that just me thinking wistfully. i bought a refurbished acer xf250q and the bottom of the panel flickers when set to 240 hz the flickering goes away when gsync is enabled. is that normal Lol??? you #8217;re essentially paying a premium for the x570, if you really want all of its flashy features than go for it. what #8217;s ur peak sr no, it is muscle tension I promise. you just become hyper fixated on it after a panic attack and hyperfixafion IS normal with anxiety prone people. unsub different types of panic attacks?  i used to have these attacks where I would hyperfixate on my breathing and hyperventilate and I #8217;d focus on my heartbeat and swallowing and convince myself I couldn #8217;t swallow and it was not a fun experience, however it #8217;s been a year or two now since I last experienced a panic attack like that. I didn #8217;t notice these as panic attacks at first but I think I #8217;ve been having less severe ones with the unwanted thoughts, heart racing, trembling shit etc. I mean I #8217;m glad I #8217;m not hyperfocusing anymore. what is th #233; invisible name character? yeah, I feel that. I get myself to believe that I will get myself to stop breathing, it #8217;s not a fun experience to accidentally impose on yourself. I hit a standing still widow how to play candy crush saga you can actually place much higher with placements depending on your performance. contrary to popular belief. ok smartass, unfollow it yeah, thought you were being a smartass. how are you getting notifications otherwise? e_e no like you seriously can, I #8217;ve had accounts where I was in gold and I #8217;d place high plat/diamond the next season. winning doesn #8217;t always net large sums of sr. the game factors in a sort of win streak bonus as well so if you consecutively win placements and not loose games in between you #8217;ll get a whopping amount of sr per win. It also factors in performance, usually k/d and that sort of things like damage blocked or healing per 10 depending on the role you play. Especially if you #8217;re playing on hero #8217;s with high win percentages. The game will try and balance your win percentage out by placing you in higher elo games. idk, I just work here yes u can. idk it was in the custom games, maybe you #8217;ll catch it. usually it #8217;s called widow hs something, I #8217;m at a festival so I can #8217;t check but you #8217;ll be able to find it im sure. omg gamers away from the game. a very rare situation! Yeah, the regular castillo or chateau ones are just called widow hs but I swear these ones are called like widow hs ___ something I don #8217;t remember off the top of my head lol. rialtoooo? maybe take him back lol bye you're not really preventing smurfing, you're just decreasing the likelyhood of smurfing on fresh accounts. 75+ would deter a lot of newbies as well. there would probably be more of a market for higher leveled accounts on igvault or wherever. not really, it takes 24 hours to get to level 25 when theres no xp bonus events. thats a lot of time to people with full time jobs. well sure, I #8217;m not talking about bad onetricks. but contrary to popular belief quickplay isn #8217;t really a grand place to learn heros for competitive. personally I started this game in silver and playing against smurfs opened my eyes to new playstyles and tactics and I would like to credit as one of the key reasons I was able to climb to gm. If you want to improve at this game competitively tossing yourself into competitive is the best thing you can do for yourself, really. well congrats on 2.4k hours in dota, but ow and dota are two different games. yeah, if you wanna get better at competitive you have to play competitive. quickplay has very little to no structure its not going to teach you how to climb very much. god I #8217;m a messssss  :) I don #8217;t really know what else to say at this point, just a lot of hurting people aren #8217;t understanding that quickplay wont teach people competitive very well. forcing people to play that shit for what, it takes about 24 hours to get to level 25 solo. so it would take around like 67 hours to get to 70, maybe more because I believe you need more exp the higher level you get. that #8217;s a lootttt of time doing garbage. exaactly I have been one of the dps players and the solo healing ana, it is pain. wtf noo. most people don #8217;t take quickplay seriously. U wont be able to learn the hero competently. why do u think there #8217;s so many mercy mains who play widow everywhere else? or plats who wreck at widow ffa? they just don #8217;t have the game sense. most of the times it #8217;s because they don #8217;t know how to play widow at the level they play mercy at. if you want to learn heroes competitively u gotta play comp. im not talking about the basics. I #8217;m talking about the gamesense you gain from playing competitive. exactly, which they #8217;d learn from playing competitive. sure, but if your intent is to learn the game competitively the best thing you can do for yourself is to throw yourself into comp if you want to learn quickly. some people have all the time in the world, other people have full time jobs or college courses. i know not everybody likes getting thrown right in though, everyone #8217;s different. some people wait, others don #8217;t. you can #8217;t expect to place very high your first placement either way, but you can learn to get out of there through grinding competitive more efficiently. I think its in the nature of quickplay itself for people to throw. people prefer to get high or drunk in quickplay than comp because there are no punishments. but that in itself depends on the person lol, I #8217;ve met many drunk ppl. honestly if they had a sort of competitive readiness game-mode where it teaches people the basics of competitive I would really like that. well yeah, I started in silver, 1900 myself on my old toaster pc. I feel like smurfs helped me learn the game better quickly, not all of them are sitting there wrecking noobies. some Smurf #8217;s actually introduce team compositions etc and help point the team to a win more efficiently than someone in silver might not know exactly, which is why I credit it to helping me climb to gm. Sure it #8217;s not fun going against a smurf in low elo, but I think it should be taken as a learning experience, seeing how they rolled you sort of thing and using it whenever u can next time to roll more people and climb out of elos. you #8217;re not going in totally blind. as I #8217;ve said, getting to level 25 in itself takes about 24 hours of game time. something to teach game compositions would be neat, overwatch doesn #8217;t really explain that to you when you get first introduced to the game. It would be neat if there was a #171; #160;meta introducer #171; #160;sort of thing. th #233; higher level you reach the more exp is needed for the next level. blizzard doesnt do 1k per 1 level. yeah! ow #8217;s little tutorial in itself is nice, but it only really teaches newbies how to play soldier sort of. and we all know soldier isn #8217;t really the only thing to this game lol. Maybe if they revamped it and elaborated on things new people might not get off the bat it would serve more of a purpose than it has currently. more like passing fire no stopppp I dunno if it should record coms honestly, some people wouldn #8217;t like that stuff recorded. I def understand for scrim purposes though. really excited furball I #8217;m not just talking about you, cutie. poor gegi you would definitely need people to consent to it, that would be a nice little feature. a really pretty mutt maybe? : D read the other comments :) I think she missed, I dunno what grav negation is all about CCwatch (: guys there #8217;s only one wasp. how can they even exist enough to eat then wym??? that entire r/ is a SCAM try and not fill as much. if you #8217;re playing characters your not decent with or flexing too much you #8217;ll really mess yourself up aw you thought you were special. :* cc stacking is so fucking tilting. its called sarcasm, and it clearly doesn #8217;t play well with you. no ones attacking you? are you thick skulled? we been known yas cant really give you the best, it #8217;s all personal preference. sometimes people can get so depressed that they want to die but don #8217;t even have the motivation to kill themselves.\n",
            "subject1248***SEPARADOR***I just distract myself using any means possible - YouTube or sleep are my favorite distractions. Me too. I feel like I don't fit in even in so-called \"safe spaces\" where everyone else seems to make friends so easily. Honestly one of the reasons I'm still going is because there's always books coming out that I want to read. Can't read if I'm dead, so... Me too - even on good days when I'm waiting for the train I think, well I *could* theoretically throw myself under it, but meh. I see rafters and think about hanging myself. It's less of an emergency than something that just happens and I don't really feel the urge to act on suicidal thoughts. Kind of awkward when I don't look before crossing the street and my friend jokingly says, \"I'm a college student who just got an assignment back, run me over!\" How'd you know what I was thinking? Public transportation. Plus I don't have friends so I have plenty of time. Learn and read and definitely enjoy school more. I would learn every language I could and specifics of historical events. Requiescat in Pace. November 9 by Colleen Hoover. I don't think I hate a book more than I hate that one. Reading. It's excellent on public transportation. I've had severe social anxiety and depression since 7th grade. Six years of being a teenager and I've spent most of it at home in my room, I don't even remember what I did most of the time. I made a couple acquaintances that weren't really friends. I missed my prom and after-parties. I've never had a group of friends before. I'm in my first year of college now and my social and emotional growth is so stunted that it's difficult for me to connect with anyone. \"What's up?\" I never know how to answer. I'm 18, still get children's menus at restaurants. Got yelled at while walking in Paris for seemingly no reason. I've told people who aren't my parents, and most of them said, \"It's probably because you're Chinese.\" On the plus side I'm the only person my parents know who didn't have anything stolen while in Paris. Me too. I've always been shy but in seventh grade I was bullied, generally by exclusion - people would act like I wasn't there and talk about me behind my back. I knew what was going on and they knew I knew what was going on. I just kind of stopped talking to anyone after that. I moved schools the next year, but that came with a healthy dose of severe anxiety that the same thing would happen. I had one friend at the school from before, but I didn't talk to anyone else. I was invisible and to me that was better than knowing I was being ridiculed. Rinse and repeat every year and now it's so bad I can't talk half the time I'm supposed to. This happens to me a lot too, because one little thing triggers doubts which after a while turns into \"I'm a failure of a person\" and then I just want to sleep for the rest of the day. It's ridiculous really :/ I'm probably gonna end up not studying for two big midterms I have in two days. I'm the opposite, I'm terrified of not knowing that I'm dying. Even if I can't do anything I'd rather just know. I had a period of a few months once where I barely slept because whenever I would start getting tired I'd start thinking, \"This could be the last time I go to sleep.\" Not in a hurry to relive that (though I guess it'll be a while hopefully lol) I'd rather go the assisted suicide way - then I'd know beforehand AND not be lucid when that happens. Scared shitless of failing out of school, disappointing my parents, and having nowhere to go in life. I have social anxiety. Talking to people, asking strangers brief questions, ordering food, e-mailing people, phone calls, are all hell for me. I stutter when I talk because I'm so nervous, so I try not to talk much, and as for e-mails - I have to ask someone to send it for me (I write them out and have someone else press the send button because I can't do it) In my experience telling someone in a bad situation \"it gets better\" doesn't help. At all. I'm fine being anonymous on social media. Not fine with emails to people I know. I did that in one of my classes, but the teacher was an expert in talking incredibly quietly. :/ Can confirm. We also bitch about Quebec and Saskatchewan. I'm game for all Christmas carols. I was fourteen and in the library reading when this college-age guy came up to me and started talking to me. (I'm short and look for my age, so he wouldn't have thought I was even in high school.) Anyways, he ended up asking for my shoe size, and puzzled, I replied. He asked if I could double-check, so I took my shoe off and I did, and while it was off he picked up my foot and started feeling it, talking about how he was an artist and needed to know for an art project. I was pretty naive and unassertive at the time so let this go on for about a minute growing increasingly uncomfortable and creeped out. And then I looked at his face, and he looked really excited. Pulled my foot from his grasp, put my shoe back on and ran off after that. It was really fucking weird. Always. Doesn't help that I've had a great childhood and supportive family, it only makes me feel worse because I should be glad my life is so great. I always feel like I'm pretending to be depressed so I can continue being lazy. Frankly, it's ridiculous. But if I was really just lazy and not depressed, I wouldn't feel so guilty about it, I'd be happy about all my free time and put it to use instead of not wanting to do anything. I'd play video games all day instead of feeling too awful to even enjoy video games. I wouldn't think about dying all the time. I wouldn't feel like I was a piece of shit for going to therapy and wasting people's time. I'd be elated about pulling off a deception, but I'm not. So. I guess that's how I try to convince myself. Still. It's irrational but I guess that's the nature of the illness. Best: Harry Potter Worst: Westeros I did until I had three back-to-back 75 minute classes over lunch hours. I'm still uncomfortable, but I'm hungry, dammit. iPhone charging cords. I just lie down in my bed and watch YouTube/Netflix until I fall asleep.\n",
            "subject1384***SEPARADOR***Tell him it #8217;s better than going into an overthinking spiral and going crazy. If he likes you perfect if he doesn #8217;t atleast you #8217;ll have closure.Also the guy sounds smart enough not to end a perfectly good friendship over something like this.Good luck #128077; #127995; PS I have a crush on someone so I can totally relate My crush is a dead end most likely but I really hope it works out for you and maybe you are what makes the guy change his mind.I am a bit of a fairy tale person so I apologise if I am being way too optimistic but good luck #128077; #127995; The lady was doing my eyebrows and her hand slipped which gave me shitty thin uneven brows and I had to go see my crush with those eyebrows and also attend the college fest.Perfect timing #128522; Since it #8217;s already messing up your head bad I say go for it.You already said you can #8217;t keep doing what you already are and maybe she feels the same and if she does that would be beyond perfect and if she doesn #8217;t atleast you #8217;ll get closure and stop the overthinking spiral.Also you don #8217;t necessarily have to end the friendship after confessing your feelings. It #8217;ll be 11:11 am on the opposite side of the world not 11:11 pm Epic show cartman is funniest Do I take a break and not text him.I am guilty of mostly texting first. Yeah we have been talking daily.Today he joked about a snap that he put and said things I do for love.I know he doesn #8217;t have a girlfriend but could it possible he is considering someone else?He told me he doesn #8217;t have time for this way before I told him I sort of liked him. Never He lives in a different country.We recently met when he came home but it wasn #8217;t a date or anything like that. Yeah I should do that Thanks #9786; #65039; I think that too but sometimes he would flirt or do something which actually make me think he actually cares about me and I get confused everytime. Well we do live in different countries lol but I do get your point.I don #8217;t think he sees me as more than a friend.Thanks #9786; #65039; Yeah I understand.Really thank you so much though #9786; #65039;.I #8217;ll try moving on.I mean I have to.Thank you really #9786; #65039; Like telling your crush you like them #128522; Uni is somewhat suicide in itself I haven #8217;t seen him in like 2 months.He came home a while back and we hung out in the gym a few times but that was pretty much it. What if I do tell him and he says no and then I end up ruining this friendship too or whatever in hell this is? Totally agree #128175; He won #8217;t be here till next year I guess and even then if it isn #8217;t the country issue it might be the religion issue or the age issue (he #8217;s 25 I #8217;m 21)or simply I am just not what he wants.He says that I shouldn #8217;t expect anything from him so what #8217;s the point of putting yourself out there when I already know the outcome.Trust me I wanna do that and get a concrete answer and move on.But I am just scared it #8217;s gonna be a no and I won #8217;t even be able to move on.I mean who is stupid enough to have a crush on someone since 3 years. But isn #8217;t it so hard maintaining this friendship?I am always checking if he has seen my messages or if he seenzones me or ignores me it breaks my heart.We live in different timezones.Its almost his bedtime by the time I wake up and vice versa but still somehow I feel I would be ready to risk everything for this one guy.I just don #8217;t have the guts to tell him cause I know the answer is gonna be no.If you think there is something and it might be yes maybe you should give it a try.Maybe we should give it a try. I sometimes think he likes me.Its really weird and complicated.I had a crush on him when he was here but it was one of those crushes where you just look at the guy and smile.I didn #8217;t even know his name.I found out a year ago added him on Instagram and we started talking but he lives in a different country now.We talk daily.Sometimes it does feel like he is into me but it #8217;s really confusing and he always says not to expect anything off him so there is really no point in my case.But if you think something can happen with your crush I say you go for it.Even I told this guy I had a crush on him once but then laughed it off and it was stupid.At this point I am considering clear cut telling him that what I feel for you is really strong and I can #8217;t keep talking to you and be friends hoping maybe one day you #8217;ll fall for me. You are not a bad friend if you have feelings for him.Don #8217;t mess yourself up over this.You can do this. It #8217;s like this short story I read in high school Case for defence by Graham Greene Mine #8217;s halfway around the world and you sir have given me a lot of hope I told him that I like him and can #8217;t keep talking to him and hurting myself.He said same told you not to expect a lot and somehow this is his fault too.I really don #8217;t know what he meant by the fault thing but we have still been talking but I don #8217;t know what I should do.Do I keep talking and like totally forget everything or do I stay strong and not talk? Thanks for being so supportive #10084; #65039; I really don #8217;t know how I feel but I am relieved he clearly knows now.No mixed signals or confusions.But he sometimes acts as if he doesn #8217;t give a fuck about me and other times I am the first person to know when anything good or bad happens.Makes me question what I exactly am in his life.This is why I told him in the first place but I still have so much uncertainty in this matter.I mean I know a relationship is out of the question but then what am I? Even prior to telling him one day I am his best friend other day excuse me who are you.So it #8217;s really confusing. When you talk does he keep the conversation going or is mostly you asking the questions and trying to talk? I am really sorry but that #8217;s not a good sign.It was like this for me too but I have learnt from recent experiences that if someone wants to talk to you or be with you they #8217;ll make an effort to show it I so need this It looks like that cat from that cartoon show which I can #8217;t remember who was an alien Totallyyyyyy Oh yeah it was kid vs kat The theme music is playing in my head as I am typing this lol Make your own notes especially of the stuff you find difficult.I am not sure of your syllabus but we had various cycles like ketogenesis,cholesterol synthesis etc and they took a lot of time to memorise.So it #8217;s best to make notes or something like that for it.Some teachers do prefer their notes but if your information is right they can #8217;t ignore that.Take someone else #8217;s notes and just look once so that you don #8217;t miss anything important that #8217;s only given in the notes. Finals start in 10 days and I haven #8217;t even started studying  I am in med school and my finals start in 10 days.We had send ups last month.They are like exams just before the finals to help us prepare for the real thing.I haven #8217;t studied a word after send ups and I just can #8217;t seem to focus.I waste too much time on my phone or overthinking stupid stuff.There is a lot of stuff that I couldn #8217;t cover during send ups and planned to do it now but I just can #8217;t focus and study.Any tips? 4 subjects, 10 days and I plan to start preparing for the first one a couple of days before finals start.And my unhealthy phone addiction.I hope I make it.Thank you #9786; #65039; If people weren #8217;t procrastinating and wasting all their time most of the social media and memes would be non existent. Don #8217;t cha worry.When the time comes I won #8217;t kill anyone We #8217;ll see about that.I ain #8217;t dying or killing anyone yet. Okay I give you this one #128079; #128079; #128079; I simply meant we don #8217;t prescribe medicines YET I tried that.Went for a couple of days without instagram and Snapchat but then broke down and downloaded them again.I might give it another try though.Thanks Really pathetic and self degrading Why am I not good enough for him?Why not me? I know it #8217;s really stupid Social and preventive Medicine I made it Don #8217;t worry you can do it too #128077; #127995; That #8217;s exactly how I feel.Legit the same feeling.But what you are saying is right.If he doesn #8217;t care then what #8217;s the point??? My friend texted my crush who I had been talking for quite some time and who kinda knew I had feelings for him that I was ready to marry him and have his kids.So I kinda get you.I think you should chill now and see how he reacts after break.Tell him it was a stupid joke or maybe you thought he was kinda cute and it #8217;s nothing.Try to keep it casual and cool. I made it yayyyy #127881; Thanks for the suggestion.It really helped. I made it through the finals so yayyy I have never been in a relationship but I have seen someone very close to me be in one.You know it #8217;s abusive when there are more fights than you can even remember.Its abusive when he tries to control every aspect of your life,when he considers you his property or some possession,imposes restrictions on you.Bottomline when he doesn #8217;t let you be you.When he doesn #8217;t let you hang out with your friends cause all your time is his time. Imagine being in that situation even without being in a relationship with the said person. The worst thing though I can #8217;t even think about being with anyone else.And this guy did make me feel special.It wasn #8217;t all in my head.Also I am 21 and he #8217;s 25 so the parents aren #8217;t the reason he isn #8217;t responding.He moved to a different country a couple of years back and he came back this year and totally surprised me.He made up some silly excuses and then he was like surprise I am home.We actually started talking when he had already moved to a different country. Yeah I get that.And I get the parents thing too.Where we live parents play a big role in deciding who we date and can have as a partner and he is from a different religion.Frankly I don #8217;t think I have a chance and I am so tired of trying.And he lives so far away.Maybe that #8217;s why he didn #8217;t want anything.Either ways I know I gotta stop.I just don #8217;t know how. I know but it #8217;s so hard.I can #8217;t even imagine blocking him.Isn #8217;t there another way.Also it #8217;s really petty but I do want him to see if get with someone else.He knows how much I can care and love someone.I want him to see me doing it for someone else.I know it #8217;s incredibly petty and stupid and unhealthy.And I don #8217;t wanna do this cause he didn #8217;t reciprocate my feelings.Its cause he is still playing with this knowing exactly how I feel.You must think I am pretty stupid by now. That is actually a great idea.I should do that.Really thanks. All I do is study and workout and gym just reminds me of him.No kidding you actually reminded me to have a life. That #8217;s another thing.He had abs and I was fat.I am leaner now but not slim.But he never made me feel fat.Before I started talking to him I never thought a guy like him would even look at me.I had serious self esteem issues.I had friends that said look at him and look at yourself but he never made me feel like that.Not once.And I watched him stand in front of me getting all shy and finding words to talk to me and I see him now being a total ass.I am sorry I am ranting.I am gonna try and cut him off.I know that #8217;s the right thing to do.Thank you so much. You totally get it.I tried so hard to impress him.Picked up hobbies he was interested in.Cared for him.I would make sure he was up for his job,took medicines when he was sick blah blah and he is nothing to me.He isn #8217;t mine and will never be and I should move on.And frankly I am tired of trying to be good enough for him.Tired of trying to get him to talk to me.I should rather focus on myself now.So thank you for that. Blue smokey look God I feel so powerful Who said I barely made it? I did better than that.Thanks for the suggestion though.Don #8217;t know how you live with such negativity inside you You think I am dumb enough to not care for my patients.First of all I am a student and not a clinician yet.I kick my ass studying the entire day something really tough.Its natural to be paranoid and to get too stressed or used to the monotonous life.Yes I wasted some time before my exams but that doesn #8217;t mean I didn #8217;t study before.I passed really tough exams to even get into this college and it wasn #8217;t all a fluke.I wouldn #8217;t have even cleared the first year if all my life was a fluke.Sure you have concerns about some doctors but all I am saying is when I put this post I was stressed out and losing focus and not that I didn #8217;t study everything beforehand or that I don #8217;t care about the field I have chosen.I am already preparing for the field I wanna specialise in and doing research work all on top of my regular classes. If you still think I am joke I can #8217;t help it. You don #8217;t even know my result.I had 10 days to go for finals.And I had given send ups.I said I hadn #8217;t studied anything after send ups.I have studied regularly for a year.Of course I wanted to revise whatever I had studied before because everything is tough and you tend to forget so many symptoms and disorders. I have a long complicated crush story too.But I am afraid mine is reaching the end. Dude that #8217;s amazing.You #8217;re seriously so lucky!!! My crush hasn #8217;t even seen my text I sent hours ago and we have been talking for over a year.Low key jealous of you but it #8217;s great to see atleast someone is getting lucky or some romantic shit out there.Good luck with her #128077; #127995; I think it is.Its been quite some time since I visited Singapore but I went to Switzerland a few months back and from a tourist view point it is very expensive but the beauty of the place is totally worth it. My case is a little complicated too but thanks.Hoping to get a text back before I fall asleep.Its way past midnight anyways or maybe I should sleep.Whats the point anyways.Sorry I am rambling.Continue your date #128077; #127995; #128077; #127995; #128077; #127995; Ohh I am a girl waiting for my guy to text back.Its day where he lives so yeah.Could be busy.But she fell asleep next to you.Thats soooo cute.I am legit squeaking at my phone.Sooo adorable.I wish I could fall asleep next to him. Thanks for your support but your situation is so cute.PS the girl is pretty lucky too.You seem to be a nice guy.Good luck with your relationship #128077; #127995; Which movie btw? Try to take a break one you get tired so that you don #8217;t get too tired.But try to listen to music or take a walk or something for break.I tend to waste a lot of time on social media during break.Like the 10 min break suddenly becomes half an hour.But that #8217;s just me.Good luck #128077; #127995; I can feel this so much.If he hasn #8217;t given you an answer you need to move on.It sucks and quite frankly even I don #8217;t know how to do that.But you need to.You need realise your worth and realise you deserve way better. My mom has threatened to disown me on multiple occasions and I still won #8217;t learn #128514; Medical textbooks can get real tiring real fast cause there is so much information to memorise.I am a med student too.I suggest you make a plan of what you wanna accomplish in the next one hour or even 20 min and keep your phone aside during that time period.You #8217;ll feel a sense of accomplishment and will keep doing it.Thats what I usually do.I also tried deleting a couple of social media apps during my exam to help me focus. I did that too I am med student too but the books clearly say that the method has a very high failure rate.Especially compared to other methods.And in general condom also prevents infections and STD especially if you have multiple partners. That #8217;s what I suggested but she #8217;s deeply hurt and want him to suffer. May sound a little creepy but look at her social media.If she has a boyfriend she might have posted something with him. Yeah go ahead.Good luck:) I don #8217;t have a chance with him but we #8217;ve been texting for over a year now.He #8217;s so Cute and so damn adorable.Never listens to me.Elder to me but still sometimes acts like a kid.Takes my breath away when he walks into a room.He #8217;s always very confident but gets all shy and nervous when he #8217;s talking to me in person.He can be a jerk too sometimes but I don #8217;t know why I still love him very much.he always calls me kiddo even though I tell him not to. One of two things.Either he likes you and is too shy to admit it.Probably wants you to make the first move.Or maybe it #8217;s nothing.I have been in both situations.This one guy had so much eye contact with me and even showed interest the one time we talked but then suddenly changed overnight.So I think you should make the move.Atleast you #8217;ll know. Ocean blue eyes looking in mine I think I might sink and drown and dieeee #128525; Marrying my crush There are a lot of reasons.Age,different religion(where we are from it #8217;s a major factor) etc etc but what should I do?Stay friends or tell him I can #8217;t and end it? When I confessed I told him I can #8217;t keep talking to you cause it hurts too much and I failed miserably.I always knew that nothing can ever happen between us but I hoped it somehow would.My story is long and complicated and I would love to tell you if you are interested but I am finding it so hard to give up.At one point it all seemed destined to be. Nope I am 22 he #8217;s 25 about to be 26 Why do creepy uncles at the gym have to pull up their shorts to look at their hairy non existent adipose filled quads when clearly they are sharing the same tiny mirror with some girl young enough to be their daughter.And the staring.I mean come on.Atleast respect your age.This one time I confronted one and he didn #8217;t even fake deny it.Picked up his jacket and left. Trust me no body says that.The guy I confronted was following me around the gym.Everywhere I went.And I could always feel his eyes on me.So he #8217;s a creep.You are in a room with so many people and mirrors.The occasional eye contact is natural but you just know when someone is being a creep. Exactly.Sometimes I do avoid if they are actually too old but if get the total creepy vibe from them I sure go upto them. Medicine surgery Peds gynae.Will rock my final year.Though the number of pages I would have to eat would probably give me some sort of chronic stomach condition. What is your most embarrassing gym story? I once spilled water all over the treadmill.The guy next to me offered his towel to clean it up. Not the same but I started taking off weights from the barbell only from one side and when I removed the last one it flew up into the air made loud thud and everyone came running.So embarrassing. This scene has my heart The thing is we actually never happened.For a year and a half I made him my everything but turns out I was nothing to him.I knew every little thing about him like some pseudo girlfriend. A friend made this and I figured it belonged here This scene has my heart.Pam #8217;s smile when Jim asks her out and she that lip bite her total expressions basically are one of the finest things we have been blessed with in life. I volunteered for pulse polio campaign a few months back as a medical student.People were really supportive.We collected the data for MR campaign along with administering OPV and it #8217;s well accepted in the community That #8217;s a big thing.Especially regarding the recent MR campaign. whatsapp and media were full of shit like it #8217;s not good or whatever without thinking how essential it is for the health of children and doctors take all precautions while working with needles. I totally get it.I have never been in a relationship and everyone around me is in one.I am 22 and have never been with anyone.Everytime we go out all my friends dress up for their special someone and send them pictures and there I am looking in the mirror with no one to impress.I help them choose what to wear for their dates,hear their stories with no story of mine.And I am girl.Girls can be alone too. I need him to be my personal trainer Were you dropped on your head during childhood? Family goals.I gym so I can do that one day. Burn the onions-Kevin Malone Thanks I have been trying to get over him and love myself but I feel it #8217;s so tough Thank you so much.Its been really hard lately. I am only using insta and Reddit too.I just happen to have so much free time at this moment that it #8217;s tough to not think about him.I still try to stay distracted. Congratulations #127881; I legit saved this to post when I finish med school. He isn #8217;t on insta but yeah you are right.I spent so much of my time and energy on him I can put that to good use. This is so relatable and it sucks.No point in wasting your time and energy on someone who doesn #8217;t care. He tells you upfront.There are a lot of signs which can indicate he likes you but sometimes assuming stuff can hurt you real bad.I know I have been there.Till he tells you clearly he likes you don #8217;t assume anything. I am really sorry.Guys can be real jerks sometimes.I have been through all this.Infact I am still going through all this.If you need someone to talk to dm me anytime but stay strong.There is definitely something better for you out there. He #8217;s been really rude and the last time I texted him he replied after a day and a half.That hurts even more than not texting. Exactly.Then I #8217;ll have the anxiety of whether he really does want to talk or not.Its been so many days and nothing from him.Thats a message in itself. I am sorry I already know he #8217;s gonna say I am taking time off social media or whatever.Last time I texted him he replied after a day and a half.Might as well not send him anything. Hope things get better for you. Nah already sick of this life why would I wanna make it infinite Holy shit that #8217;s the worst.It would kill me.My crush has played me for way too long with these mixed signs that I am so tired now. Loving you is hard cause you are you yet I still do it anyways and beyond measure. I meant your own legs and doing compound movements at the gym. See you gotta focus.Think that you have to work your ass off this week and you don #8217;t have time to cry right now.You can cry as much as you want once you are done with exams.Keep your phone aside and just get to it.Realise you don #8217;t have time to cry.Thats what helped me go through finals week.I went through that exactly.But you have no choice than to study. He was my senior.He would always treat me a little special but I didn #8217;t think too much into it cause we were very very good friends.He wanted a picture together at the college fest but he had to leave a little early so he called me up to ask me where I was and I told him never mind we can take it next time and then I realised there would be no next time and this was it.That was the moment I knew(It was the last year of his college). It just got messy.He kinda got together with someone else and we lost our friendship too.He said he liked me but then talked about kissing someone else and got into a relationship with another.So I guess he was just confused and I got caught up in it trying to figure out if I read the signs wrong or he just couldn #8217;t make up his mind. It #8217;s natural.Just try focussing.Keep your phone aside or whatever it is that #8217;s bothering you and get to work. Need to start somewhere I hate those people.If it was upto me I would slash their Tyres lol. I am 22from India.Love the office.Got my heartbroken,lost people to death too.Medical student so know something about medicine and forensics.here if you need me.Ohh and I am a girl. Don #8217;t trust anyone.People are damn good at deception. Khabib training moves I kinda wanna post this on Instagram lol Why ofcourse Dwight did I have had marital fights with my crush who won #8217;t even acknowledge my existence anymore Anybody know which episode is this from? Thanks :) My feelings for him I have been in your place once and even though I am quite comfortable at the gym now I am very demotivated and don #8217;t do shit.I am totally in :) Read the stuff over and over again.Relate things practically.Depending on the proff you are in.Like if you are studying anatomy focus on diagrams and try to correlate with what you saw on the cadaver.If you need any help let me know.I am a final year med student. Spoiler alert:-Reading it and memorising it still hurts a lot Wait till you read about the extensor compartment of the forearm or the calf muscles or the sole of foot.I have cried actual tears for them #128514; Meeeee But that doesn #8217;t mean that they are actually mean or unapproachable.I suggest you talk to her.Take an advice or something if she #8217;s better than you.Dont be creepy but take your chance.I know exactly how you feel,being attracted to someone #8217;s determination.I missed my chance so I am telling you from experience try to make a conversation or something.Get to know her.Be a little charming.Take a chance. Need help urgently  I am new to After effects and need to get the hang of it asap.My senior asked me to make a video of it which is to be released tonight at midnight.Any help will be greatly appreciated.Tbh I don #8217;t have the time today to watch lengthy tutorials.I just need to know the basics a little bit. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds :) This is gonna sound real dumb but what is keyframe? I have never worked with this.Infact I just finished downloading the software 10 min ago. I have half the video ready.I need something like a boom announcing our project.Any idea how to do that? And the boss thing she #8217;ll boom me if it isn #8217;t good. You are absolutely right.I have been myself all morning.I managed to make some text explode and now I am using windows movie maker to finish it off.Thank you so much for your help :) I know.I am sorry.I was just so confused with this and had no idea where to start.I figured it out a little bit and now I am working with the stuff I know to make something good.And yes it makes me wanna kill myself so your RIP might come in handy. I am not dumb.Why would I say that?She told me about the software in the morning and I said I #8217;ll look into it.I just didn #8217;t wanna give up without giving it a fair try. I am gonna do that next time.I can #8217;t do this especially without any help or training.I am gonna tell her to hire someone next time. Beating those superior species whenever they invade the earth. You need to tell her.You are killing yourself anyways.Its been a year now.Maybe she #8217;ll like you back or reject you but atleast you #8217;ll know for sure.This emotional turmoil would end and you won #8217;t have to keep wondering. I didn #8217;t mean to offend anyone here.I was just looking for help.I didn #8217;t wanna let anyone down but I told her it #8217;s not my thing and I can #8217;t learn it so soon so she can hire someone else or be happy with what I make.I didn #8217;t make any false claims .I was just hoping for someone to help me cause I was so short on time.Thanks for your help :) I #8217;ll give it a try.Thank you so much #9786; #65039; We had been talking for some time.He lives in another country but then he came home and totally surprised me.He just texted me come here I am home.A few days before he had to leave he stood in front of me and his eyes told a different story.He was shy and smiling and looking for words to keep talking to me.That was it .That look on his face,his eyes,that #8217;s when I fell for him. Perfect.Thats the word I used to describe him too.But work on yourself and believe in yourself.Thats the most imp thing.Don #8217;t stress too much.Things have a weird way of happening. Yeah make a move.Doesn #8217;t matter if you are a girl.Take the chance and have no regrets in life.Its always better to know if the other person feels something so that you are not wasting your time. That #8217;s so true. Most guys approach women who look approachable or someone who #8217;ll likely say yes easily according to them.Looks obviously help but it #8217;s more of how guys perceive you. The way he folds Quite possibly the reason my mom wants to disown me but I love the chair.Priorities right. Falling in love with the wrong one I so needed to read this.I am going through something exactly similar and the story is exactly like a fairy tale right from the moment I saw him and we hit it off so well.Even though we just text(he #8217;s in another country too) I can know what he #8217;s thinking it or if he #8217;s upset just like that.I don #8217;t know the exact reason why we #8217;ll never work out but I know we won #8217;t and I should work on myself first. Thank you sooooo much for writing this. Everyone has feelings... Guess this one in the million too No one should drink and drive.If you don #8217;t value the one life you have been given enough atleast think about the people you leave behind and what impact it can have on their lives. You need to change how you spent your breaks.I used to waste a lot of time on social media and my 10 minutes break turned into hours.I deleted it and it helped.Try to keep your phone aside.Maybe listen to some music and walk around a bit when you take a break.All the best #128077; #127995; I am not entirely sure of your test pattern but practice numericals and derivations again and again.Try to do different type of numericals.Like instead of doing 10 questions of the same type try to do 10 questions of different type so that you can solve any problem.Also focus on the reasoning questions.Again not sure if your test pattern but hope this was helpful.We used to get numericals and derivations of formulae a lot. Yes.Her boyfriend is too controlling.He demands to know where she is at all times,she has to take his permission before going out or even attending a class she wants.He even decides when she can go and see her parents and gets mad if she stays home too long as their relationship is secret and she can #8217;t talk too much when she #8217;s home.She doesn #8217;t see it cause she #8217;s dumb.There is one thing being blinded by love.This is whole another level of bullshit.She is also not allowed to spend too much time with her friends.And he can spend hours with his friend and not even pick up her call.Thats no 1 boolshit. Ohh I forgot for light do the ray diagrams nicely.Thats the easy part.Waves is the tough part.Practice that more. Please re rack your weights.Don #8217;t just leave them where you were working out. Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick Thats what I thought.It doesn #8217;t take her two minutes to turn on me and be back with her boyfriend so why do I kill myself caring for her and thinking of her well being. This might not be the best advice but maybe you should talk to him.I mean if he reciprocates your feelings then perfect otherwise you have solid reason to move on and it #8217;ll be easier.Also just like you I have never been in a relationship in 22 years of life waiting for the perfect one but now I am thinking that maybe I shouldn #8217;t be so uptight and give it a chance.I mean if it #8217;s meant to last it will otherwise it #8217;ll be a lesson.All the best #128077; #127995; Tbh this post made me a little hungry but yes get to know him.Maybe he does like you.It seems so.This is a very cute story and could be the start of something amazing.Just be prepared for whatever may happen.It does seem like that he likes you but even if he does make sure never to question yourself.All the best #128077; #127995; My stomach is actually throwing a temper tantrum as I am reading this.So needed to see this. Blush a little.Its alright.You #8217;ll look cute. Kevin is a sweetheart They have each other #8217;s passwords.As long as they are together he #8217;s gonna check her ID.All I want is for him to atleast not open my texts.I can #8217;t even send her any meme or something he might find offensive.I guess I #8217;ll just stop texting then. It #8217;s more like I don #8217;t want him to know what #8217;s going on with me.Like I went through some personal stuff and opened up about it to her.Shes #8217;s my best friend.She can share anything she wants but the stuff that even I find hard to admit to myself I admitted to her and I didn #8217;t want him to read that.I can #8217;t even send her a simple meme or anything if he finds it offensive even though she might be cool with it. That #8217;s exactly my point.I am pretty sure he read the personal stuff too.Thats none of his business.I know my friend respects my issues enough to not discuss them with him and her relationship is complicated and kinda toxic.So I don #8217;t even say too much. We stay in the same hostel so usually we hang out all day.Since we were home for the holidays texting was the only option.She doesn #8217;t use her phone too much at home so calling her is not a good option.Also as far as a wedge between us is concerned he is the reason we are not that good friends now cause she keeps choosing him even though he cheats and is abusive. Exactly.I have decided to handle my own shit myself.As far as the cheating and abuse is concerned I have tried telling her so many times.Its her choice what she wants in life. You mean for your love? I think I might prefer dehydration. Lol just kidding man.I love all berries though blueberries are my absolute favourite.Too bad we don #8217;t get them were we live. They aren #8217;t married.They are far from marriage.The guy cheated.They have had each other #8217;s passwords since the very beginning but few months ago he changed his,refuse to gave it to her and then she changed hers too.Even though she eventually found out that he cheated not once but like thrice she got back with him. You have no idea how many times I have tried.When she recently found out she had old me to talk to him and I literally told the guy to fuck off and leave her alone.Then she told me she wants to give him another chance and I tried to convince her then said it #8217;s either him or me.She said she won #8217;t talk to him but kept persuading so I finally gave in provided he won #8217;t abuse her.But now I see her ignoring me cause of him and then saying I am the one walking away and even took his side when I confronted him and told him to leave her alone.You have no idea how shitty I feel right now. I don #8217;t know what to do.Her birthday is coming up and I wanna be there for her.But I hate being ignored.One thing is for sure that I am not giving her any advice or anything like that.The worst thing is I have been with her through everything.All fights,problems,every damn thing and now she says you are not in a relationship so you don #8217;t understand.Just basically rubs that in my face and that felt so bad. Yeah yeah.See we are still friends.I feel like we are just not as close as we used to be.Since we practically live together we spent a lot of time with each other.Her family is practically my family.Maybe all this is in my head.We have been away at home and I haven #8217;t seen her in a while.Maybe I am in a mental competition with her bf.I feel like she takes our time to talk to him but doesn #8217;t even drop me a single text.I know all this sounds really stupid but thank you so so much for listening.I really appreciate it. My thumbprint is on her phone lol.Thanks for the advice though.I think that #8217;s what I #8217;ll do. I wish to study in UK.I study medicine in India.Maybe I #8217;ll do my masters there. I know you don #8217;t.The last time I was talking to a guy I liked I realised my cheeks were flushing.Then I looked in the mirror and I looked kinda cute lol.Thats why I said. Helpful mostly In case she is committed to her boyfriend and is in a serious relationship you just have to suck it up and accept it.I know it sounds harsh but what #8217;s the point of beating yourself over something that might never happen.Just stay low and give it some time.Also this sounds totally contradicting but maybe try to get to know her a little.You have never talked to her.Maybe she isn #8217;t what you want but you don #8217;t even know it yet. It doesn #8217;t matter if you #8217;re a girl.Go for it.All the best #128077; #127995; People who are in love always find their way back to each other and end up together. Ohh and also if a girl likes a guy in a movie the guy always ends up liking her back in a twisted meant to be scenario Always get so hungry watching that movie Currently watching season 7 and feels like Harvey will date anyone but Donna  No doubt his relationship with Dr Agard is good but he and Donna get along so well and he knows how good he #8217;s for her.She is exactly what he needs and for some reason all through these seasons he #8217;ll date anyone except Donna.He isn #8217;t even her secretary anymore and he can give it a chance.He can #8217;t even see how much Donna likes him and cares for him or he chooses not to. Like I am actually watching Donna be hurt right now when he reveals his relationship to her and I feel her man.Donna loves him so much but Harvey will run to every other option than Donna. Holy shit now I realise how sleepy I was when I wrote that lol.But still she is what he needs and he can #8217;t see that. Why do you think that? Why shouldn #8217;t he give that relationship a chance? I am not really sure of your grade system.We have an entrance exam for med school but I was in your position once.I struggled with physics.I thought I couldn #8217;t make it.So I spent all my time doing numericals and working on my weak points.Again I am not sure how much time you have or when your admissions start but if you put your mind to it and start working you can do it.I start my final year of med school on Monday so it is possible as long as you believe you can do it. I guess.I might have been projecting my life onto them. People call me nurse even though I am a doctor just cause of my gender.I don #8217;t know why males feel doctor is a superior job which can only be handled by their own kind. You can put a little oil on your spoon to prevent the honey from sticking.Just a little over the surface works like magic everytime. He wasn #8217;t.I wanted to play on the word jiu jitsu cause he is into martial arts. Anyways my apologies.English isn #8217;t my first language. I got some frozen ones.Real expensive.I wish I lived somewhere I could get them fresh. I live in India Never ever give up! Headache due to intacranial hypertension.Felt like smashing my head with a hammer. Uhh my heart My crush lives in another country and this one day he just shows up at the gym and texts me hey I am back home.Come to the gym(that #8217;s were we actually met for the first time before he moved to another country).I couldn #8217;t believe it was happening.I had no idea he was coming home.He had told me he won #8217;t be coming home till next year so it was a total surprise. Enchanted and you belong with me-Taylor swift Need a guy like this Feels like I am the second choice in every friendship  I just need someone who #8217;s understanding and won #8217;t treat me as an option.I love talking and listening to people and sharing my story.But right now I feel like shit cause everyone would choose literally anyone over me.If anyone wants to talk hit me up. Maybe you should tell him.I am fatter than my crush too.But see the thing is if it #8217;s something real and there really is a connection it won #8217;t matter.My crush has abs and I am sure he never judged me for being fat.Infact he always supported me.My story isn #8217;t the ideal fairy tale where everything worked out but letting out your feelings does help.Atleast you #8217;ll know for sure if you need to move on. I feel lighter after confessing.We are still friends but every situation is different.If it messes up your head too much you should just tell him.He might like you back and in case he doesn #8217;t atleast you won #8217;t keep beating yourself up about it. The duration.Some people think since they have been with someone toxic for so long they should continue the relationship.They ignore all the red flags and continue it solely because it #8217;s been so long that they have been together. Should I ask him out?  So there is this guy and we connect.Last night I told him the kind of guy I want and he told me that #8217;s exactly what he looks in a girl.Thats basically me.I don #8217;t wanna ask him out and make it awkward cause we are in the same college and it can get really weird.He #8217;s shy and awkward too and probably why he won #8217;t ask either. The last time I took a leap it didn #8217;t work out and I am scared tbh.Should I ask him or keep waiting for him to ask me out? Is it worth waiting for someone who might be too shy and awkward to ask you out when it isn #8217;t even clear if he #8217;s just shy or if he #8217;s not into you?  So I have this friend.He #8217;s my senior and we usually just text.But if he runs into me in person he gets all awkward won #8217;t even say hi and pretend he didn #8217;t see him.we hit it off while chatting.We had a joke that we #8217;ll find someone for each other and I told him the kind of guy I want which is kinda like him.He told me he wants the same things in a girl which is basically me.He #8217;s told me before he #8217;s shy and awkward but I am not sure if he likes me or not.The things he said he looks for Ina girl,I fit the criteria but I am not sure if I should make the first move and ask him out.What if he doesn #8217;t like me?It would be very awkward and weird and I don #8217;t wanna embarrass myself. I guess.I have wasted years on someone,made the move but it didn #8217;t happen.I guess now I am just scared. I guess.Its just weird asking him out.What if he says no and then college will be so weird and everybody would be making fun of me.Sounds stupid I know but I am just confused as to how I should proceed. Your situation is so similar to mine except it was in the gym.I searched for my guy for so long and eventually found him.I am not exactly sure how you should go about it but I hope you find him.Umm maybe check the followers of the guy who put his pic.If he #8217;s on Instagram he would be following him.Unless you really really like that coffee place and don #8217;t wanna risk ever going back there you should just ask someone there.Its easier and atleast you #8217;ll know.The guy did seem into you. Just go there and see who #8217;s most friendly and ask them if they know who he is.Go from there. The guy I like has this hot model friend.I check her profile religiously.Maybe he doesn #8217;t even like her but I feel so insecure.Always thinking maybe I should be skinny model like her.I have been trying to get rid of this unhealthy obsession.The only insecurity I have is I think he would choose her over me even though we get along really well. Is it weird the first thing that popped into my head was my crush lol Perhaps it #8217;s a good thing he doesn #8217;t live near me.Might have given the lickpocalyse a try otherwise. This is so adorable #128525; #128525; #128525; Thissssss Fuck kickboxing Marry squats and dead lifts Kill running Ex love of my life said it wasn #8217;t talking it was just replying back after two days or a week after we had been chatting everyday for over a year and a half and I wasn #8217;t the only one initiating conversations. Spot reduction.You can #8217;t just lose fat from your tummy by doing more crunches or thin out your arms by training them.You #8217;ll lose it eventually by working out and maintaining a calorie deficit. Put all sorts of stupid gym stories on Instagram and learnt kickboxing which wasn #8217;t too bad tbh Your crush always likes you back.The cool jerk guy not only falls for the sweet innocent girl but also changes himself for the better just for her. It sucks  It sucks when you are there for everyone during their time of need but no one is there for you when you need them. It sucks when you consider a friend so important that you would do anything for them but when it comes to their shitty ass cheating boyfriend you don #8217;t even exist anymore. It sucks when you clean her tears but when you are crying she is not even near you. Life sucks. You should totally change yourself and give up something that makes you special only to impress a total stranger who you thought was the love of your life. I am not saying she doesn #8217;t have any problems.Definitely more than me.But I am always there for her.Always.But she saw me crying and not being in a good place and left.And I am not gonna bring this up cause she #8217;s just gonna say her problems are bigger cause she #8217;s in a relationship and since I am single I won #8217;t get them. 22 F looking for a good friend  This is not my first post here but everytime I hit off with someone it lasts for a few days and then it #8217;s over.Right now I am feeling really low and missing someone I shouldn #8217;t be missing.I can #8217;t text him and I shouldn #8217;t.Need a friend who can help me through this phase.Thanks in advance to anyone who responds :) Hey what #8217;s up? He #8217;s in dental college and I am in medical college.Same city still haven #8217;t seen him in years. Again and again and again  It happened again.Someone chose another human being and forgot all about me.Maybe I am just good for texting.Maybe I am only good enough to be a support system when you need me.Maybe I am only good enough to talk to for hours on end but not actually ask out on a date. No but this time I was careful.I didn #8217;t run after you.I took my time to fall.You kept texting me.Hell I can still see your notifications popping up as I am typing this but you want someone else.But now I have fallen or I think I have and just like all the other times there is someone else. I miss you  I miss you.Wish I could say that to you rather than typing it here.You know I did kicks yesterday.You always helped me with kickboxing.I finally did some kicks yesterday.I so wish I could show you what I did.Maybe you could tell me how awesome or terribly wrong I was. You know what,I am scared.You became such an important part of my life and now we don #8217;t even text and I am scared I #8217;ll forget you.Its been weeks since we last texted each other and those moments when I don #8217;t think about you.Sorry accidentally don #8217;t think about you cause I am busy or talking to someone I get so scared.I wanna move on but I am so scared of forgetting you.I know you probably have forgotten all about me.I don #8217;t even wish I could do the same.I still want you even if it #8217;s just in the memories. I will always love you even if I forget you. XOXO kiddo(I always hated when you called me that) Guys who text a lot,are they shy to meet you in person or just disinterested?  I have a history of talking to guys and hitting it off.We end up texting for hours on end but when we run into each other in a social setting they ignore my existence.I am not particularly unattractive.But I don #8217;t get this.Why not talk in person if you text so much.Especially if you have said you want a girlfriend and I clearly showed an interest in you.Why completely ignore my existence in person? We either go to the same gym or same college.Yeah they know what I look like.Like one was my dreamy gym crush and we actually ended up texting for over a year and half.The other was my college senior who initiated conversations too.We text about general stuff.The senior usually complains about being single blah blah and I am thinking to myself I am a girl.Ask me out.We clearly hit it off well and he described the kind of girl he wants to date and I fit the criteria. He did Muay Thai too.Kept calling me kiddo cause I am younger.We live on the opposite sides of the world so I would send him videos and he would correct my form.Wake me up to watch ufc matches.I wish he could see I finally did a kick. Maybe.Just felt a connection.Its not like I don #8217;t have guy friends.I am sorry I am being a cribby kid but I am kinda falling for him and I am very very scared to be hurt again.Maybe I am not his type afterall.But even as friends he can say hi to me if we run into each other if we spent hours texting. He was a runner too.I run away from running #128514; Sure I will tag you :) I know he #8217;s a little shy and moreover we are in the same college.I am not too sure but apparently he asked out someone in the past and got rejected.Maybe he #8217;s just too scared.People talk and maybe he just wants to avoid public humiliation.Not that I would tell anyone or even say no in the first place.But he can still say hi.Saying hi in person doesn #8217;t mean we are dating or am I not cool enough to say hi to. The year and a half case was a total bullshit phase of my life.Thats why I am scared for the other guy.Is he shy or just wants to be friend.He got shit drunk and flirted with some chick the other day but he won #8217;t even say hi to me in person. Perhaps I could score a date in the virtual world then :(.Reality isn #8217;t working out too well for me you see. It sucks though.When you text for hours but god forbid we run into each other during a social setting like a college party or work he doesn #8217;t have to ignore me like I don #8217;t exist especially if we were up talking till 1 am the previous night.I am not a social outcast if that #8217;s what you are wondering. I made the move last time only to get hurt but I understand that was more of an impossible situation.This guy initiated conversations.Now I am falling and he #8217;s talking about other girls or the fact he wants to focus on his career and stuff like that.Plus he #8217;s in my college and I don #8217;t want to be laughing stock.So I am very scared.What if I am not his type.His friends all have very showy girlfriends. Maybe.He told me he got shit drunk and was flirting with some girl from another college but he doesn #8217;t want anything serious so won #8217;t pursue that.I saw him leave with arms around her that night.I was at that party too.I ignored his texts the next morning but then he texted me again and we again ended up texting for hours.He isn #8217;t too responsive these days and I don #8217;t feel like texting me. I don #8217;t know anymore.I know he isn #8217;t a fuckboy really but I don #8217;t know if he is shy or what.Maybe I just thought it could be something real with this guy after all my stupid virtual crushes and I just love talking to him.I just wanted to get to know his better to see if it could have been something more. DAE feel they do more for their friends but when it #8217;s your turn your friends are never there for you? Yeah I guess.It would be easier though if he would atleast spare me a look but thanks for your help ;) Hahaha thanks for the offer.I am just confused if I should risk confessing.I am pretty sure he #8217;s gonna say no only and does he even deserve a confession if he can #8217;t even say hi to me in person.If I confront him about it he #8217;ll be like I didn #8217;t see you,I was too drunk blah blah. Yeah we did end up talking about all this and my feelings after I put this post. He told me I am sweet girl and he can #8217;t do me wrong and he doesn #8217;t want anything serious.Spent an hour trying to console me.I am doing fine but ofcourse it hurts a little. This almost brought tears to my eyes.Thats how badly I wanted to read that. You are in for an adventure.Its gonna be amazing but shit expensive.If you do go to Switzerland make sure you have Interlaken on your list.Eiffel tower at night is magnificent. Yeah.But I think I am gonna take some time off and focus on myself.Of Course after I am done eating a tub of ice cream and everything sweet in my sight.But I am really tired of all that has happened over the past few months.I feel mentally exhausted.Like I wanna run away but I don #8217;t have any place to run to. Gym is the place of my first heartbreak lol.Quite the reverse situation here but yeah I love working out and I am not gonna give that up.Just gonna spoil myself today,workout and get back to work tomorrow .Thanks for all your help. Holy shit.It feels like I am the one who wrote this.Seriously what do you do in such a situation.I lost all this weight and I am still single.Only guys I don #8217;t want pursue me.I am told I am pretty but still single till date. I did start getting more attention from guys but no one worth pursuing.I am literally in the same situation as the user who wrote this post. My story was exactly the same.Well till she said yes and agreed to be your gf.My guy said you can have a strand of my hair and clone me and keep me forever. My story was exactly like you l.confessed to move on and get it over with.Really happy with the outcome of your confession :) Hey I am 22 from India.I get that feeling.I have been through the same thing.Text me of you ever need to talk. Heyyyyyyyy Good good what about you? Same here I hope the same for you :) Watching the office is the tv equivalent of having abs.Extremely attractive. That is so cute though #128525; #128525; #128525; I would so happily accept a flower from this little adorable creature #10084; #65039; Should I text him or not?  So basically I had a crush on this guy,he knew but we were still good friends.Recently he said he needs time off of social media and doesn #8217;t want to or can #8217;t talk.Basically we didn #8217;t end on great terms.After like a month of no contact he comments on my recent Instagram post and replied to one of my stories.My friends think he wants to talk but I shouldn #8217;t because he said pretty hurtful things the last time we talked and I was finally moving on.But I can #8217;t stop wondering whether I should send hey,have a little chat.I miss him Ofcourse.I am scared what if he ignores me or is rude again. It #8217;s been way over a month since we talked.So I shouldn #8217;t send a hey? I am exactly like you.At this point I have started considering do I only like guys who won #8217;t like me back? Any suggestions for what I can prep for breakfast?  I am new to meal prepping and I live in a hostel.I can cook the meal at home but ultimately I only have access to a refrigerator and an induction for storing and heating purposes.Any suggestions for breakfast as I am always late and need to grab something fast. I really like the overnight oats idea.Might even add some protein powder to it.Thanks :) I might make a batch of muffins.Pretty easy and I can have them along with some coffee.If you have any good recipe for banana oat muffin or any other healthy alternative please let me know :) Thanks :) That #8217;s some really good options.Thanks :) Thanks :) First time meal prepping.Grilled chicken,Cauliflower rice and roasted broccoli. This makes me so hungryyyy *they call you that. I am so sleep deprived that I was upvoting the upvote button in the picture and then wondering why is my screen not working. Yep.The sole basis of our friendship is mutual insult.Its almost like a little competition of who can roast better lol. Waking up We are served shit here. Please just don #8217;t  Now you are texting me.After a month of no contact now.You said some pretty hurtful things last time we talked.So unless it #8217;s an apology please don #8217;t text me. Hope you get well soon.There is always always something worth living for and someone does value you.Just look around and if you can #8217;t find one look in the mirror.That person is very valued and loved.Hope you have a great day :) Symmetry in nature Legs for me too.I used to hate my legs cause they were fat.Loathed them.Ever since I started working I have fallen love with them.Even though I don #8217;t have thin pretty legs but I feel so strong and I absolutely love them. TIFU by dropping my airpods in the water while talking to a cute guy at the gym  So there is this really cute guy at the gym and we often exchange glances but I am too shy stupid piece of shit to go upto him and initiate a conversation.Its been a few days and today I thought if he looks this way I #8217;ll pass a smile or something.So it happens that we are getting water at the same time(purely coincidental lol) and I had my boxing gloves in one hand and my phone in the other.I strategically place my gloves on my arm to get some water when the guy asks me do you box? So this is him initiating a conversation and I am beyond excited.I take out my AirPod to talk to him and with so many things in my hands and me being an utterly stupid awkward being I drop my AirPod in the water while talking to the guy.Then I proceed to make an even bigger fool out of myself by cursing and panicking over the loss of my beloved babies.I don #8217;t think he #8217;ll make a move again after seeing the mess I am. TL;DR Cute guy approached me at the gym.Got nervous and dropped my airpods in a glass of water making a fool out of myself. I #8217;ll smile and say hello the next time I see him.Hopefully he won #8217;t run away lol. Hope so.I was doing for cute kickass girl in the gym.Ended up with that lol.Hopefully he found my messy self adorable and won #8217;t run away the next time I run into him. *throws dumbbell on the foot to look cute lol Thanks for making me feel better though :) That #8217;s gonna be my go to breakfast now.Looks amazing. Goodboi I want a goodboi This is so true.I would definitely want a guy to make an attempt to know me as a person before anything else. It takes a lot of hard work to get into med school.Dude career and life first.There are gonna be plenty of people.I am already in med school and I legit spoiled my 3rd year crying over someone who wasn #8217;t nearly worth it.Thats the biggest regret I have.People come and go.Focus on yourself and your goals. My best friend started dating my other friends boyfriend #8217;s best friend  The title is self explanatory as confusing as it maybe.Ever since she started dating him she #8217;s naturally closer to the other friend as they are dating two best friends and I feel so left.Not only do I have no one in my life now I don #8217;t even have a friend.I drive around alone all day trying to cheer myself up but nothing works.They are always talking about their bfs and other common stuff.What am I supposed to do? Stare at their faces when they are texting their boyfriends.They can atleast have the decency to put the phone down when they are with other people.But if I say anything I am the bad one. My best friend #8217;s relationship is new.She recently got out of a very toxic relationship and I always supported her through that and she still ignored me then.I understood then cause she always blamed the guy and how he doesn #8217;t want her to spend much time with her friends.I don #8217;t wanna sound some attention seeking friend but I just hoped things would be a little different now after everything I supported her through and how the guy ultimately cheated and left her.I am extremely happy she found this new guy.He #8217;s really nice but I just wish she would just get off her phone once in a while and look at other people around her. Not at all good.Sad and lonely and nobody wants me. Lately I can #8217;t stop eating.I don #8217;t know what #8217;s gotten into me but I just can #8217;t.This might sound like a desperate call for help but it is what it is.I am literally eating again as I am typing this and I had a proper lunch and breakfast.I can #8217;t seem to stop.Someone please help me. I can think of a couple of things bothering me but there #8217;s not much I can do about it and it #8217;s seriously affecting my studies.I feel so hungry all the damn time. Thank you so much :) I #8217;ll try meal planning and keeping myself hydrated and most importantly busy.If I am working I won #8217;t be hungry and sad all the time.Thanks :) In the rom com novel version they fall in love and live happily ever after I might make waffles for him :) I feel like I can never be happy or love myself  This sounds like a desperate call for help.Maybe it is.I feel like I am stuck in a rut and I #8217;ll never be happy.I lost a ton of weight and that felt good for a while but then it didn #8217;t.Nothing makes me happy anymore.I know I should love myself before expecting anyone else to love me but why is it so damn hard?All my friends are in relationships and I have been single all my life.My friends say I am pretty or cute and I am interesting but I somehow refuse to believe that.I am constantly belittling myself thinking what is it that they have and I don #8217;t.Why doesn #8217;t anyone like me?Am I that bad?Don #8217;t I deserve to be happy.I am not exactly sure what I am doing here but if anyone of you can put a smile on my face even for a millisecond I will be eternally grateful to you. I am so sorry you had to go through that.I hope things are better for you now. I did sprints at 18km/hr today.Thats my personal best and I am not the fittest person.I am just so happy #128512; Quit To my parents  I came home cause I am sad and lonely there.I can #8217;t talk to you about everything but you know I am not doing good.You talk to me assure me that you support me and want me to think positive.But the very next day you again expect me to be perfect.I can #8217;t be normal in 2 days when all I can think about is how everybody #8217;s life would be better if I wasn #8217;t in it.I don #8217;t want to be like this.I don #8217;t want to cry all the time.All I want is someone to hold me and say that they are here and I matter.I feel like a burden on everyone and I am so so tired.Please please understand I am not doing any of this to hurt you or cause you trouble.I don #8217;t need anything from you just some love and affection. I really thought it was a legitimate hobby 2meirl4meirl It #8217;s my favourite pastime too I actually thought that was popcorn when I first looked at it while scrolling. He basically watched me workout and then texts me it makes him happy to watch me workout He #8217;s written Hindi in English if that makes any sense.People in India do that. That #8217;s tough to type.This is way easier. The ice in my iced coffee melted before I could drink it. So needed to read that.Bye Reddit I am off studying. This is soooo me.I am fucked(laughs nervously) Medicine Iced coffee was supposed to make me more alert so that I study medicine.But by the time I sat down on my table it was too late. Would I still be your daughter if I am not perfect? Mine told me he #8217;ll send a piece of his hair and I can clone him if I want in my life. I am sorry I don #8217;t get that Now I get what he m- It #8217;s she gets i- Why do I relate with her so much? More live no more will to function but let #8217;s go with the arthritis thing.Physical pain definitely gets more attention than mental stuff. Are there any podcasts I can listen to while studying?  I am sorry if this is a stupid question.I am new to podcasts and want to incorporate more of them in my life. Woah woah you are in for a surprise That #8217;s what she s- Yeah I agree.I usually listen to some music while studying.Helps me concentrate better.I was wondering if there was a podcast out there with something similar. Thanks for your help:) I #8217;ll give this a try.Thanks :) I #8217;ll listen to it.Thanks :) This sounds interesting I prefer calm music too.Rarely something with words.I figured maybe there is a podcast out there which would help me concentrate better. Me too.If you have any suggestions let me know :) I #8217;ll definitely check it out thanks:) The hottest criminal Mesmerising ceramics Mesmerising ceramics The way these ceramics are made Buy expensive razors so that I can cut myself in style.Rest on quality shit expensive booze. That #8217;s Amy Santiago All people say is you gotta do it yourself  I know they are right.Nobody can help me.I have to help myself.But I wish somebody would say you have to do it yourself but I am here to help you get there.Somebody who knows when I say I am fine I am going to go to my room and cut myself.Just somebody who gets me.It takes a lot of courage for me to even speak when I start to spiral,to call someone for help.Even if my best friend is sitting in front of me I can #8217;t speak a word to her,tell her what #8217;s going through my mind.I don #8217;t want to tell anyone.All I want right now is alcohol and some razors or maybe someone to save me cause as much as people say I gotta do it myself I have given up.I can #8217;t do it.Please just someone help me. Thanks :) What if the someone is from your country but moved to another country? Which country is he representing then lol Same here.Haven #8217;t been truly happy in so long. Worth all the trouble if I just get to see him once That #8217;s amazing.I am two days clean.Keep going man! It #8217;s 1 g per kg Atleast that #8217;s what they teach us Me too.I used to love working out.No matter what happened gym was my happy place.Didn #8217;t miss a single day.And now nothing.I literally have to pick myself to go there and once I am there I just sit around and come back. I used to love Neurology.So passionate about it.Started a research project in my second year of college.Now I am not even motivated enough to finish or even read about the subject I loved so much.Nothing makes me happy anymore. He #8217;ll tell his life stories.Like how hard he had it and how easy it #8217;s for us.How he had to walk miles to school. He takes care of a lot of things without letting either of me and my brother know.Like if I go home in my car when I come back to college the fuel tank is always full.Its probably a very small thing but he does stuff like this not as a gesture but just something he thinks dads are supposed to do. He stands for half an hour in line to get chicken when I have to come home cause he knows I love it.He always goes out of his way to make us comfortable in every possible way. I love him very much Heartbreak You know what  It took every fibre of my being to text you.We haven #8217;t talked in months.I was doing good at pretending you don #8217;t exist in my life anymore.Thats what you wanted right.Ofcourse you made a few appearances when you wanted but no this time I wanted to keep my self respect.But today,I couldn #8217;t do it.The cutting didn #8217;t help,getting shit drunk didn #8217;t help,losing all my friends certainly didn #8217;t help and jumping from the fifth floor seemed like the only option when I decided maybe I should keep my self respect aside for just one night and text you.Literally beg you to talk to me cause I could really use someone to talk to.But you did what you do best.Left me on read.Thanks dude.Right now jumping off the fifth floor seemed like a much better option. Every damn day I was cutting myself under the table today. The way the candle is lit Every damn day [2meirl4meirl] Every damn day Nah I am sure it #8217;s his number Today was #8220;almost #8221; a good day  I did a great boxing workout.I wore tank top for the first time in my life.I have always been really conscious about my fat arms.Never wore them.But today I did.Felt confident af.But then I was reminded of how lonely I am.How nobody would even know if I vanish.How my best friend thinks all I want is a guy.Basically how my life sucks.So now I have vodka in one hand and I am typing with the other how I #8220;almost #8221; had a good day. The toy is so cool I watched the movie last night.There was applause hooting and everything.The movie portrays Kabir Singh as MCP.Sure he was a jerk and being a medical student myself I could see how many things are wrong there.I personally hated the girl #8217;s character.Kabir stood for her at every aspect and she let him.I presented a paper,I was critiqued but that taught me stuff.Him standing on the stage while she delivers a speech was fucking ridiculous .The girl couldn #8217;t do anything by herself.Come on.I could go on about the flaws honestly. But Maybe Kabir Singh had an obsession.Maybe he actually did love her very much even though his way of showing love is looked down upon.But what is shown in the movie actually happens.People feel so fucking vulnerable these days,scared of a broken heart and doing every possible thing to fix themselves and trust me it #8217;s not easy especially when you have the stress of mbbs on you.I would have loved to see him get out of it in a better way.Hell it might have helped me get out of my spiral.Hated the end. WHILE PEOPLE ARE GOING ON ABOUT HOW KABIR SINGH PORTRAYS LOVE AND SOCIETY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO SEE HOW IT ALSO SHOWS HOW BAD YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CAN GET AND HOW ITS A CRY FOR HELP. Edit:- PS I hated what he said about fat girls being teddy bear and nice and caring.I have been fucking rejected for being nice and caring.Guess what I am fit now still rejected still drinking myself to sleep so stop thinking fat girls are some cute pandas or something.We can be bad ass too. Feeling wanted I wish I didn #8217;t hate myself and wasn #8217;t so sad and lonely all the time. It #8217;s worse when you were there for everyone in every possible way but now when you are the one going through stuff they pretend they can #8217;t even see you are going through stuff Wouldn #8217;t I still be lonely? Doesn #8217;t feel like it but thanks. Aren #8217;t I already? I don #8217;t ask for help much but I could literally be breaking down in front of them and they won #8217;t even bother. Oh my god the exact same thing has happened to me. Nobody dates teddy bears.They are just supposed to be nice right Will I ever get over __________ I have been in this situation twice and honestly I got my heart broken.I really really really hope this works out for the best but don #8217;t get your hopes too high.It hurts bad in the end. I have been in this situation.The first one lasted for over a year and half.Texting daily.Even after confession which somehow kept the hope alive(the confession was after a year of texting daily). The second case again.I am still talking to the guy daily but man it hurts when he talks about some other girl or he #8217;s too shy to talk in person or whatever. Just be careful.I don #8217;t want you to get your heart broken. One really good advice someone gave me was #8220;unless he says clearly I like you assume he doesn #8217;t #8221; And in case you really do and feel like telling him would take a load off of you go ahead and do it.Its better to be over with it now than to keep suppressing your feelings for so long.I know both these things sound contradictory but I hope you find happiness whatever the outcome maybe. I am from india too man.Thought you are from Hyderabad when you wrote ex Muslim state.I am a punjabi.Few years elder to you.Doing mbbs and regretting it lol. Yeah I read that in one of your comments.Sounds really weird but all I can think about is kebabs and biryaani lol. How are doing btw? Story of my life I am just so tired of pretending to be happy  People say if you pretend to be happy eventually you will be.When I was in a better mental space I gave so many fucks about people.Taking care of them.Basically being there when they needed me and here I am stuck and nobody is there to help me.I was always there for the person I called my best friend.From covering for her pregnancy and taking care of her during her abortion,supporting her through her abusive relationship and always making her my priority.She always has some guy as her priority and honestly I am sick of it.We cleared the air last week.I told her I have hit so low and you aren #8217;t even there.I am cutting myself,drinking to sleep,can #8217;t focus,crying all day.Its so so hard for me to ask for help but I still somehow gathered the courage and got shot down every damn time.I will deal with this alone.I will drink.I will cut myself.None of these people need to give a fuck about me.But atleast don #8217;t even pretend you do. Asking me not to drink my morning coffee is ridiculous.Its my life.I will drink the god damn coffee.You can #8217;t be here when I needed you.Now telling me not to drink coffee cause you care about me and how it #8217;s not good for my health is bullshit.I don #8217;t need you beating me up for having a cup of coffee.(Sorry this last part doesn #8217;t make any sense.My so called best friend beats me up for having coffee daily with breakfast and honestly I got tired of it and said fine I #8217;ll throw it in the trash and she walked off pissed at me).Motherfucker couldn #8217;t be here when I was crying and cutting myself literally standing in front of her crying.Why the hell she cares what I drink. Again sorry for this rant.Thanks to anyone who took out the time to read it. Same in India Paid the last instalment of my med school tuition fees :)  I have been feeling so unmotivated and hating myself and life in general.Been going through a dark phase of my life where I have been isolating myself and cutting and thinking things will never get better.Feeling empty.But walking out of the accounts office yesterday,it felt like how close I am to finishing this.I #8217;ll be a doctor by the end of this year.That is something to look forward to.Something that I used to be so passionate about.I don #8217;t how long this feeling of euphoria and motivation is gonna last but I sure as hell see myself as being something more than who I am today. It #8217;s hard to get professional help.Being surrounded by doctors all day I feel like they are just gonna say it #8217;s the stress of the final year and I can #8217;t really talk about what #8217;s bothering me cause of the fear of judgement.But I am trying to take baby steps to get better. Yep.Then I start one year internship and prepping for my post grad Yeah they would but then again they are also my professors and talking to them would be hard.Its hard for me to talk to anyone really cause I know they are just gonna judge me.We get free consultation inside the hospital where I study and I don #8217;t afford to go to any counsellor outside and my parents are not big on the whole mental health thing.According to them I just need to think positively. This.I keep wondering couldn #8217;t it have happened at a different time.This is the most important year of med school and I can #8217;t even a look at a book right now.Its not like I don #8217;t try but it #8217;s really hard to focus when you are breaking down and barely managing to keep sane.The fact that nobody even checks up on me,the constant feeling of loneliness seems to suck the life out of me. I am in 4th year now.Working out used to be my thing.I hit the gym even close to finals.But now it takes so much energy to even get off the bed.I have been hitting the gym pretty hard this week to keep myself sane but then I get so tired I can #8217;t study.I haven #8217;t experienced the post workout high in ages.I feel empty driving to the gym.Feel empty coming back.Just generally tired of feeling like this all the time. No I am in India.Yeah I have been trying kickboxing to calm me down.But it does get me very tired.I am also looking into tennis.Will be taking a few lessons this month. Me too.Needed to hear that. I went to the gym today and the lib.Read a small topic.Its nothing as compared to what I need to study but it #8217;s a start. He called me a nurse even though I am studying to be a doctor only cause I am a female. His total disrespect for everyone was such a turn off.The idgaf was only sexy for some time. Despite the awkward pose the jogger does look cute lol. He #8217;s gonna be in a shit ton of memes though. Oh my god I have done that more times than I can remember. I have an exam tomorrow.I should probably ___________ I woke up from a nap to read this lol Does anybody feel totally drained and not having any energy at all?  I slept well last night,barely did anything today.But it feels like I have no energy at all.Like I can #8217;t even stand.Hell I feel like I don #8217;t even have the energy to type this.I am so tired of feeling so empty all the time.Isn #8217;t ending it all better than feeling like this?I mean who would even care.I am just so tired and I haven #8217;t done a thing. I miss you  I shouldn #8217;t really.I am supposed to hate you right.But man I miss you.Come back just once.Pleaseeeeeee. Yeap.All the damn time.Its like I wanna hurt myself :( He won #8217;t :( I wish I were Sarah Today was supposed to be good.I finally felt like studying after so many months.I wanted to do something good.Get up.Then shit happened and now I have already cut myself and I don #8217;t want to stop.I just wanna keep going back to the washroom and make more cuts.I give up. Anybody has trouble asking for help?  I take one step forward and two steps back.Just feels like I can #8217;t do it anymore and if I ask for help from someone they are just gonna get annoyed.How long will I bother someone?I so tired of feeling like this.Some days start good.But by the end I am cutting myself and putting up a post here.I just wanna rush to the washroom and cut myself again.God what am I supposed to do :( Woah I wasn #8217;t even expecting a reply.I am sitting in a room without anything I can cut myself with.I don #8217;t have alcohol to numb this or make me feel something.I don #8217;t know what this is.I can #8217;t sleep.I can #8217;t study.I am just sitting here.I don #8217;t know what to do.Feels like everything is just spinning around me and I am stuck in the centre of it all. 22 Female Coffee Waffles Depends on what genre you like Why could go wrong If If someone improvise simple barbell curls Hey man.Whats up? 21st is a biggg number.Happy happy birthday!!! Don #8217;t forget to pamper yourself today.Its your day. I did that today.Even though I have an exam tomorrow.Just didn #8217;t have the energy to do anything. Now that #8217;s a genre I had forgotten about lol. Honestly I don #8217;t watch many movies but I love watching the office.It always makes me feel better.Have you watched it? I have heard if it yes but I haven #8217;t watched it.My country just released their version of the office.I am not sure if I like it or find it utterly annoying.They have copied all the characters but no one can replace Steve Carell. India Yeah.Its alright.Visit in winters though.Kinda depends where you are going.Where are you from if I may ask? Yeah same username as Reddit What #8217;s your username? Yeah I like to workout and bake but I haven #8217;t done either in quite some time.I somehow manage to show up to gym but I don #8217;t have the energy to workout anymore. Edit:-Just wanna confirm your username cause I got a couple of requests last night And I can #8217;t even get a duck to kiss me My first journal.Been battling depression.Thought this might help :) Hey.Maybe I can help :) That #8217;s heartbreak in a video Same here.I feel exactly like you do.Exactly the same situation.It sucks and it #8217;s so hard to put yourself out there again. Same I had a feeling it was a little photoshopped but I was very impressed by the fact they didn #8217;t hide the stretch marks.People assume stretch marks are something unreal and should be removed. I got my eyebrows done !  It #8217;s probably pretty insignificant but I have been putting it off for months thinking what difference would that make?Who look at my ugly face.Had totally given up on all forms of self care.Feeling accomplished in a weird way. Thank you! Feels nice to be appreciated Thank you so much:) I used to take care of myself so much.Pamper myself.Think I am a princess or something lol.This small thing today made me feel like I can do anything.I hit the gym later and did a good workout after so long. I read the title in Doug Judy #8217;s voice This is actually pretty smart I was recommended Reddit by someone.I hadn #8217;t even heard of it before but it #8217;s life changing.People here are so supportive and I made some good friends.People really help you through tough times.Makes me wonder how people who have no idea who you are and live across the world and can be so much nicer than those sitting right next to you. I liked his comment from 179 weeks ago  I was stalking him and saw some girl flirting with him in the comments and ended up liking his comment on his picture.Fuckkkkkk. I am trying to get over him cause we don #8217;t have a chance but this is gonna send such a wrong weirdly creepy message to him. Man I need a dog.I am in a really dangerous situation. I kinda have history with the guy and we are supposed to be in a fight or a Cold War really.I was taking a stand lol.Thats down the toilet now #128514; Hahaha this cracked me up Maybe it #8217;s really late at night or whatever but even this made me laugh.Atleast a decent chuckle. I have been in a similar situation so many times.It sucks man :( From crush to crash :( It #8217;s like I set myself up for hurt and disappointments sometimes :( On the rare occasions I use Facebook I keep looking for the downvote button and miss it so much.People post absolute shit sometimes. Yep.Happens all the time.They #8217;ll be like how do you know that? I often joke I am stalking you to creep them out further before reminding them that they told me so in the first place. You #8217;re so cute :) Smile bigger.I bet you look cuter when you smile :) I used to smile but recently I have lost my smile.But hey keep going.Don #8217;t be deadguy no more lol These kind of people are the worse.Its tough as it is for people who start a gym cause they are so self conscious.I remember being one of them,so conscious about my weight and the way I look and my physical incapabilities.Though I have met plenty of bullies who judged me for being fat I am just happy I met a couple of people who encouraged me and made me believe I can do it when I first started. The way these water droplets fall on the ground Feeling really down.Today wasn #8217;t a good day.So tired of being lonely and depressed all the time :(  I guess I will always be like that.I have accepted nobody is gonna magically appear to make it all better but god I wish there was someone out there for me,just someone who gave a damn about me. Edit:-Oh my god my first gold.Thank you so so much :) Edit 2:-Just noticed you literally turned the frown upside down! Thank you so much for replying.It means a lot.I am trying to take little steps at a time.I wish I could keep a pet.It would have helped so much the loneliness.I considered getting professional help but it #8217;s just not an option for me right now. Thank you so much.Its usually really hard for me to reveal to others what I am going through and what #8217;s triggering my depression. Thank you so much.Most days I don #8217;t even have the energy to even get up.I wasn #8217;t like this.I don #8217;t even know what happened all of a sudden.I was someone who could go to gym twice,manage college,cook,study etc.Now I just lie here.I hope to start getting out there.Thinking of joining a tennis class during vacations. It #8217;s hard to think I deserve anything.Everytime I put myself out there I was rejected.My friends get offers without making any efforts and here I am trying and getting rejected.But I am working on not feeling like this.Thank you so much :) I considered therapy but that #8217;s just not an option for me right now.Thanks for the suggestion though :) That explains a lot.I thought I was being ignored and deleted my post soon after posting.Thank you :) If I am that important why hasn #8217;t a single person returned my call or texted me.I know it #8217;s wrong of me to expect others are gonna check up on me but didn #8217;t I do that when they were down.One call or even a text asking how I was doing.I got so tired of hopelessly looking at my phone I eventually put it on airplane mode last night with zero expectations.I didn #8217;t even expect this post to get a response.I sometimes use Reddit as my diary.Writing on here makes me feel better and I really really appreciate you responding. I wish I was her  She #8217;s prettier right or maybe thinner.You are not embarrassed to talk to her in front of anyone.Is it that? Are you embarrassed to admit you are my friend in front of others.Either case I wish I was her.Maybe you would have noticed me then. The other day I was struggling to take a picture of my breakfast so my dad picked up the plate so that I could take a nice picture.Made my day:) I love both of your dresses She exists.Its not like it #8217;s the first time somebody has done that to me.Chat for hours and then pretend they don #8217;t even know me in person.If they didn #8217;t like my personality they won #8217;t talk to me in the first place right.I don #8217;t know.It just makes me feel really worthless and constantly comparing myself to girls they do talk to in person. Yeah.I love him for these little gestures:) Thanks :) I posted this one when it was first released .Really inspiring. I did eat after the picture :) What made me smile was the fact that my dad didn #8217;t get all annoyed cause I wanted to take a picture.Instead he helped me and then we had breakfast. Thank you so much.This means a lot :) I thought I made a good effort with my breakfast and wanted to click a picture.Its not always about impressing someone This is so amazing! I #8217;ll convey your hey and the compliments. Thank you so much :) Haha thanks It #8217;s a big part of his personality.I don #8217;t think I have ever seen him without his beard. Haha I never noticed that Exactly. I do.It looks so unreal.I legit stared at for so long.I absolutely loved it.The best I have seen. Happy birthday #127874; #127881; May you get all that you wish for in life :) All the best.Speedy recovery :) Thank you :) We don #8217;t get avocados where I live too often.I wanted to document that one time we got avocados lol. Thank you :) Please god please take me away.I can #8217;t do this anymore But it broke our hearts :( I was looking for this one The balance of this guy! That is an awesome achievement #128079; #128079; #128079; Their precision and strength is amazing and the movement is so satisfying! Thank you so much :) Granola bars for a quick healthy snack between classes Thank you :) Yeah sure :) I made it by approximation since I have been making it for quite some time so you might wanna look up the exact measurements online. Mix in oats,nuts,dried berries,chocolates basically anything you want in a big bowl. Melt some butter in a pan.Once it #8217;s melted and kinda sizzling add in some brown sugar,mix it in.Let it cook a little and add in honey.Thats the caramel thing which binds it all together.Make sure you make enough.Add it to the dry ingredients,mix it well enough and scoop it out in a tin lined by foil(I buttered the foil too to make sure it doesn #8217;t stick).Press it in nicely and refrigerate for 3-4 hours.Cut it into bars and you are good to go. Again really sorry I couldn #8217;t give the exact measurements. Individually wrapped the bars in foil so that I can carry them easily :) That actually does look so much better.I was just making it up as I was typing . Even more reasons to hate it Feeling it as I am typing this :( Definitely trying this out tomorrow! That #8217;s amazing.I am pretty much in a similar situation.Every little bit helps.I went to the gym today! Just focus on yourself.I am a girl and I used to get so self conscious and not even go to weights room.Make sure you show up everyday.Thats how you gain the confidence to be there and you start getting comfortable.Remember everyone is there to better themselves .Sure there can be some judgemental assholes there and I was really lucky to have a couple of these big dudes who didn #8217;t put me down and motivated me but you are going to the gym for you.Not them.So don #8217;t give a shit what anyone thinks.Focus on your form(look up videos online if you don #8217;t have access to a good trainer) ,blast some music and have a kickass workout :) See if that is his approach to teaching you or motivating you but honestly if he isn #8217;t what you need change him.You are paying the gym and you deserve someone who pushes you and motivates you,not someone who lets you down.Find a trainer who is better suited to you. Cause I put a spell on it Magic is what makes them taste so good :) Oh my god now that you mention it I can totally see it!!! Amazing man #128175; People who are struggling with mental health issues what is the one thing you wish others knew or understood about whatever you are going through? I kinda share the same feeling.I feel like if I share what I am going through with anyone I #8217;ll be judged and punished. Feel ya Looks soooooo delicious ! I wanna SCREAM!!!!  I just wanna scream so loud.I am tired of this.Feeling depressed,then anxious,then full of rage.My teeth hurt from passively clenching them too much.The only thing that gave me peace was talking to #8220;him #8221;.The one person I am not supposed to talk to.If I tell my best friend(who #8217;s like my biggest support system right now),she #8217;ll leave me too.What am I supposed to do? I hate lying to her.I won #8217;t text him again but I want to tell her that I did but I am sure she #8217;ll leave me too.Who will I be left with then? Aaaaagggggghhhg But she told me not to text him and I have been asking her hypothetically.Like what if I did and she said then this would be over.Its really killing me not telling her. The office helps me battle depression  I am not even sure if this is the right sub for it but the only thing that #8217;s helping me through depression is the office.Watching it or even having it in the background when I sleep calms me down.I don #8217;t feel like cutting myself or drinking.The office is the best thing in my life right now.Just wanted to let people know how this show means to me and possibly everyone on this sub :) I know.The day I absolutely hit rock bottom,the only thing that ultimately calmed me down and made me fall asleep was the sound of Michael Scott.I am so grateful for this cause that day the only way out seemed to be killing myself. Hey man.Please be careful with your medication.I study epilepsy and most cases brought into emergency are cause of reduced blood levels of anti epileptic drugs.I wish you all the best #128077; #127995; You #8217;re a really pretty girl.Stay strong! Most epileptic patients respond well to medications.All the best.Hope you are seizure free soon #128077; #127995; This makes me so happy.I hope you start doing much much better :) I am your age and exactly in the same situation.Sometimes I get so sad I just switch off my phone.Its not like anyone is going to miss me. Also why so many questions.Its pretty clear what I did but I don #8217;t wanna give every second person details about it especially when I pretend to be absolutely normal in front of almost everyone(they don #8217;t know I am going through something).So I have a couple of bullshit stories I keep telling people how I got these scars.Just don #8217;t ask.\n",
            "subject156***SEPARADOR***Having breasts. When my friends and I were little, we were super hyped about having breasts. Wish I was flat, lol Dying while giving birth or being eaten by some animal alive. I am from Czech Republic and I honestly don't like Czech food in general. It's often meat (I'm vegetarian) and too salty or too sweet or very oily. The thing I hate the most isn't that typical but we do that a lot - fried cheese. I really just taste salt and oil. The way we do steaks is something I could talk about as well. But other Czechs love it. Nobody does that anymore since I said I will kill myself if they won't stop on my 7th birthday. I was a nice kid My PE teacher at my old school. She didn't really give a fucc about our health, I had some problems with my spine and shouldn't do gymnastics - sure I got some serious lessons to become a professional or what. She also didn't let girls have a rest if they were on they period. There was one girl with serious cramps, she was suffering just sitting in the class and she was almost fainting, but the nice teacher wouldn't let her take a seat, she would rather have a kid faint in the middle of a push-up. Her excuse was that she never felt any pain, so if anybody felt anything worse than a discomfort, she told them they are faking. She also didn't have problems insulting us for our appearance or physical abilities or people we were friends with and she compared us to our sporty classmates. Nobody really cared about her, because ,,she was just leading lazy kids to sports.\" She is the reason I changed school, I was her main target for my chubby body, short height and my introversion. I sometimes have something like anxiety attack to think about her and I have a hard time facing anybody I was in a class with. Sports never were my thing but after this experience, I feel like a piece of garbage. #10024;We'll carry on, we'll carry on And though you're dead and gone, believe me Your memory will carry on We'll carry on And in my heart, I can't contain it The anthem won't explain it #10024; I would rather have girls fantasizing about me. Having friends who respect me as I am, not trying to change me, my life or my opinions. I don't need people love me for who I am, all I really need and appreciate is a respect. ,,Well...\" Mental problems and illnesses. I don't think ill people should have the name of their illness tattooed on their forehead, I just think people often know only about stereotypes (like, schizophrenic necessarily has to be violent) and a lot of people won't go to a therapy because they think they would be judged. Basically - I wish people saw mental illnesses as they truly are and not as a taboo. I can't sleep with my door open. Not the hardest, but my native language - Czech - is pretty hard. We shape words a lot and not even an average adult person would get 6th grade test for 90% right. A lot of rules and a lot of words that don't follow the rules. We also have this bad boi - #344;, #345; Pink Reacting to LGBTQ+ memes Suddenly, I feel thankful for having door It's a letter with very weird pronunciation and even some native speakers have troubles saying it. Most countries don't use that. I recommend trying to learn the pronunciation, it's an experience #10084; #65039; #128522; Your misery and hate will kill us all So paint it black and take it back Most of the Youtubers from Czech YT scene Somebody already said that, but I would definitely have a therapy Katy Perry, I just can't get into her songs, her voice is really weird (except Firework) Ariana Grande, her songs sound almost the same and her voice is very, very boring Billie Eilish, she is talented, but I feel like most of her songs are written to be deep but they actually aren't. I just think she needs some time to really become good artist, the pressure is probably too much for her, she seems scared. She has a big potential, I think her fame at this age might just mess it up. Also, her fanbase is something I can't stand up talented guy, but the lyrics... I would need to be drunk to enjoy his music Partying, being in a big group of people, going out and doing stuff everyday, sleepovers... I do have friends and I love them, but I need a lot of time alone, if I'm socializing for too long my head starts aching and my hands start shaking, I feel as if I had to throw up... Socializing is a good thing, but not for me I cried while imagining it I kinda love being part of introvert club, but at the same time I would love to be extrovert, lol Indeed. The extroverted people who disrespect introverts are the worst, nothing against extroverts, but some of them just suck energy out of me I hope it gets better for you. It's hard for us introverts, so it's nice to have friends who respect you. Not anybody does understand the space we need to recover our energy... Avocados. I love them, but I always cut it when it's too raw or too old. When they love books, drawing, anime or MBTI. I also love when people are good listeners, when they don't just wait for their turn to talk but actually talk with you about stuff you like and care. Tomorrow. I always write two M instead of two R. Also, Wednesday and February... When I like the job I'm doing, I get really focused and nothing can distract me until I'm done. I don't work very fast, but the result is high in quality and I'm pretty proud of that. I am also very open about many stuff that are taboo for other people,for example menstruation. Few of my friends said they aren't ashamed of it and don't worry to ask for a tampon anymore because I helped them open about it. Not much good. A lot of anxiety attack, people tell me I'm paranoid and I often see things that apper to not exist. I would love to go to a therapist but my mom thinks psychologist are useless and all you get from a therapy are 999999 illnesses you didn't even know about and bunch of pills instead of solving problem. Searching a mental help is one of the things I'm gonna do once I turn 18 or get out of my house. Matcha, salty caramel or tonka beans My girlfriend helped me a lot, but I never got out of it. I cut myself for the last time about 3 weeks ago but I wasn't far from doing that again recently. I usually do that when I have anxiety attack and I don't remember doing that, I just have and feel the scar. My friends let me try mariuana to control my attacks and it helped a lot. Fuck people who smoke just for fun or bcs it's cool or what, but it can be used as a cure if you don't smoke too much and know well your dealer. I hope I can control my attacks without mariuana as soon as possible and 100% stop cutting and beating myself. I like autumn, bcs it's cold but not too much, the trees look pretty and it feels nice to have a warm soup, tea or chocolate milk. Reading books and drawing also feels different during this season. The days ate getting shorter so I like to light some candles instead of turning on the light. I also love wearing thick jumpers and hoodies or wearing fluffy socks. Winter is also great, but it's too cold and the snow is pretty but I don't like walking in it. And the fluffy socks #10084; #65039; I usually put my alarm close enough to hear it but far enough so I have to get out of bed to stop it. I also put other stuff like bottle of water or my glasses far away from my bed so I have to get out of bed to get em. I became vegan and I had to check what I'm eating. When I found out what I was putting inside of my body, I started to care more about eating healthy. I stopped being vegan about 8 months ago and I'm only vegetarian, but I still care about the food I'm eating. I don't have ideal figure but I feel healthy and I don't weigh as much as I did before. You don't need to go to a diet, just don't eat shit and chemicals and find a way to enjoy exercising. I would give up touch, taste and hearing. I love food but I enjoy the smell more than taste and I love how my gf smells, I think I would survive without touch and I love silence a lot. Anything between 25-30 I stopped eating meat because I told myself this. I would never put meat in my mouth again. It was my 5th birthday and I made some friends, so I invited them thinking they would wish me nice birthday and celebrate with me. Most of them didn't even talk with me, they just went into my room, took out my toys and played with them. If anybody talked to me, it was Why didn't you invite ____? Why do you only have one cake? and other shit. I tried to join the kids playing but nobody wanted to play with me, so I just went into my room and read and waited for kids to leave. Nobody really cleaned anything, some of my toys were broken and food was all over the floor. They ate almost everything, I didn't even taste my own cake. It was a breaking point for my anxiety, I didn't have a birthday party since then and I have hard time trusting people. I was a happy energetic kid before but I turned cold, anxious and I had a first experience with self harming about a week about the party - I bit myslef or beat myself. It literally destroyed my personality. She lets her mother manipulate her, she is 18 but I think her mother treats her as a 10 year old and she doesn't have a problem with that. I think early teen age, because you get first acne, hair, menstruation (if you are a girl, of course), it all is new and hormones go crazy and you have to deal with it. Then 18-25 bscause of stress at school, getting job, looking for your future husband/wife, people expect you to grow up from a teen to a mature adult. Then 70+ because of the health problems, losing your friends and partner, loneliness etc Tattoo artist I like coffee or green tea Indeed. Thanks for reading my story. I hate when there aren't allergens in the menu. I'm not allergic to any food, but this makes me suspicious. Good manners and not talking too much. Just say what's on your mind, then shut up. I am very formal when I meet new people, I usually need to know a person for over 2 years before I open up with them, so I like when they take everything slow and don't try to have a personal talk with me. That's why I don't have friends, lol I am a girl who likes girls. Oh crap. What a nightmare. I need to be punished. The worst part of hell for me. Meat Go back in time and delete human species Menstrual cramps and back pain (I have scoliosis) Me too I always worry about breathing too loud. I would breathe slowly and just a little bit of air so nobody would hear me. My classmate who sat next to me said he checks on me if I'm still alive, lol Bras, wigs I feel like religions have no place in this century. It has done its job explaining what people didn't understand before, now we have science and facts. There is no god and never was, no Satan, no hell, no heaven... The only things we have from religinos nowadays are fights, hate and wasted time. Believing is one thing, but spending time in churches or doing some rituals is a wasted time. The stupidest thing about that are parents forcing their children to be brainwashed. Believe whatever you want, but think about your time and don't use your god to explain or suppress things. Thanks. People should learn facts instead of wasting time sitting in the church thinking some kind of entity would make their wishes come true and make them happy. Not much different from little kids believing in Santa Claus, fairies or unicorns. But the kids at least grow up and learn to live with the truth. Drugs When did you make me? I asked when I was 7. My dad told me I was his Christmas present. I didn't understand because I wasn't born on Christmas. Now I understand. What are the most uncomfortable activities or positions for you as a owner of peepee? One girl in my class was supposed to make a sentence \"I don't like when my brother annoys me when chewing too loud.\" She said ,,I haven't like when my brother me poison biting much loud.\" That's how our native language works - we say haven't like instead of don't like, we have the same word for poisoning and annoying or chewing and biting, and we say me annoys instead of annoys me. Her English didn't improve since then, I would say it's even worse. Piercings, tattoos, ginger or unnatural hair color or eye lenses, body modifications (not all of them, I don't like scarification, elf ears or coloured eye whites or any too extreme modification. Few piercings, few tattoos, I don't like extremes). At the same time, I love if person doesn't wear any make up or when girl doesn't shave her legs. Man fucking woman wearing tampon. No, they didn't have anal sex. Sushi at my favourite restaurant. The best one I ever had. Yup, September Fuck the person he was cheating with Good luck You're just lazy. Your life must be boring. I will invite some more people so it's not just the two of us. You only look at your phone and don't even go out of your room. I will call, texting is boring. You have no life. Small talk is fun. I don't understand you. Books are bullshit. Drawing is bullshit. You only think of yourself. Stop over thinking. Internet friends aren't real friends. Introversion doesn't exist, it's just people being lazy or mentally ill. You should see psychologist. You don't look like you are introvert. You are not shy, you are just not being honest. You only think about stuff, why don't you do stuff? If everyone was like you, humanity would propably still be in caves. You have no future. You are wird. You won't get job like this. When did you become like this? You must have trauma/be depressed. I'm glad I'm not like you. Why don't you make more friends, you only have few. No successful people are introverts. Go talk to people, it will make you energetic. There's more. I also hate when they come to your house without asking or talk without thinking or without breaks. Once dated extrovert, the worst relationship I ever had. I'm happy with my introverted bby now, I think I won't be able to date an extrovert ever again. People of Reddit who heard about MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), what's your type and how accurate the description of your type is? And why do you like or dislike your type? I am an INFP, very accurate for me. I love being introverted and I enjoy spending lots of time thinking, but sometimes I feel very isolated. I got this type when I tried MBTI for the first time. I really like INTPs, you are nice and smart people Glad to hear! I love the joy and energy around ESTPs, agree you are fun people! It's indeed both nice and scary how accurate it can be Sometimes it's better when somebody who knows you well tells you what is accurate about you or what type exactly you are. We are all unique individuals, so it's important to be a bit sceptical Glad you are happy with your type! Oh, that's my favourite type! I read INFPs help others a lot as well, and I don't feel like that too. We can't be 100% as the description says, but that doesn't mean you aren't good person. Your differences are what makes you an amazing person. It indeed is. I think introverts wouldn't be that shy if they were treated better, we would still enjoy time alone and have few close friends but we would be more confident and more open about ourselves. And when you tell them to be quiet they will be mean or louder. Know that feeling. I understand some people need something to believe in, the people I hate are the ones who use their god as an excuse for everything or force their religion to others. I was buying cola and there was a kid staring at me with a serious face. I asked him what's wrong and he said slowly, with unnaturally serious voice \"Cola is poisonous. Don't drink it or you wil die in pain.\" Not the scaries5 thing to hear but I returned the cola and bought mineral water to be a good example. I met him again after a while and he gave me such a sweet smile when he saw me holding a water and said to his mom \"Look! I saved her life when telling her to not buy cola!\" His mom was very proud of him and thanked me for being a good example. I felt so bad for the kid when drinking and eating unhealthy so I started eating healthier. I never thought a little guy could completely change my diet. Dark chocolate. As bitter as my mood I would get super depressed. You would see all your loved ones die, all the wars and climate changes, even the end od of the world What's the most re-asked question on AskReddit? My friend's mom didn't want to \"waste\" money on a cage for a guinea pig so they kept it in a bathtub until they got one from their grandma. When they wanted to take a bath, they put it and all its stuff into a box. A lot of books and tickets for a flight to Japan or East Korea and back for me and my family and girlfriend. Face tattoos. Some people might have nice ones, but think how will you look like when you are 40, 50, 60... and you won't be able to hide it with clothing. Cancer by My Chemical Romance and Drown by Bring Me The Horizon Thanks for mortality. It actually makes life meaningful Glass of water, half full and half empty :) Yea, but if somebody told me I am never going to die, I would get depressed about it for a while. I would get out of it and live normally, but as you said it would hit me later I dreamt about being back in 3rd grade and we had sex and porn as a subject. We only learnt theory but at high schools you would learn how to do it by doing it. Why is it \"sexy\" or \"cool\" when a girl dresses or acts a bit masculine but when a guy acts or dresses feminine he would be called gay, weird or disgusting by other men? (I don't mean transsexuality) Pasta. I love pasta, it's simple to make and there are so many ways to make a dish with it. I also think sushi would be fun, I would like to try different combinations or give people opportunity to make a custom sushi - you would have a paper of ingredients and you could choose what type of sushi you want and what do you want in it. Each ingredient would have certain price and people would mark what do they want. There might me restaurants like that but I never saw any near my city and I would love it. I agree with that face-showing, but I feel bad for men who don't like men's fashion or stereotypical behavior but if they want to be themselves, they will be punished by society. Some people would consider face-showing even a man walking out of his house in skirt or wearing makeup, even tho he just feels better that way Kimi no na wa, Koe no Katachi. Hello, I am weeb She was forcing me to go out a lot, socialize, she was too extroverted for me. She was nice and energetic, but I was exhausted and if I stayed with her for the rest of my life, we would propably end up living two separate lives, she would travel and socialize and I would stay in my room and paint and read, so it wouldn't last. When I told her about breakup, she said she was thinking about it as well because she wasn't sure if she is a lesbian or not. Turned out she wasn't, she has a guy now and we are both happy. I get very unmotivated to do stuff that would normally make me happy and I just lie in my bed not doing anything for hours and hours. When I have the worst days I forget things, memories blend together and I have problems remembering details. Everything is dark and blur and it makes depression even worse. People think I hate them because I often avoid them so I have a hard time keeping relationships. You have better days but it never goes away and it's exhausting. I think I would be that kind of person everyone was afraid of so I was burned alive, drowned or stabbed to death. Wish I could be where you are Art lessons. It might be boring for some people but if you have a good teacher who actually knows some art, you can get better imagination. That's also problem with schools (or at least at my school), cuz people think anyone can teach art. Most of teachers we had just found some \"art\" on Google, figured out how could it be made and told us to do it. My classmates who aren't in any art clubs have no idea what art is, when they see abstract art they say they could do it as well and give it some poetic name. No, you couldn't, because nobody teached you to have imagination and you propably would even know how to mix the colors. You maybe don't need to paint well to get a job, but you might need an imagination to do it well. That's too scary for others and traumatic for the kids. Focusing on your breath. Each breath in and out should be long and I like to count how long does each last. Makes you focused and calmer. If you say it like that... You don't live if you don't actually live your life and only survive. My black shirt with white crosses or my black skirt. I also love all of my thick jumpers I had a panic attack after triggering one traumatic memory. I couldn't get myself together and cried and had problems breathing and my friend told me she does have nerves for my shit and I should pack my things and go home. I went out and sat next to a tree for like 15 minutes before I had a strenght to go home. I don't under how could I ever be friends with her, she only cares about her looks and if you tell the stuff she wants to hear. I posted art on G+ and she liked it, whe started talking a lot and we found out we have a lot in common so we bwcame very close friends amd on 24th May 2017 we got together. You are welcome! Thank you as well! INFP. I enjoy reading, drawing, writing stories or watching movies or series, but most of the activities seem more interesting when done without people. You can only focus on what you're doing and you aren't interrupted by some person talking crap. Few trustworthy friends. I do have some \"friends\" but I don't really consider anyone my actual friend and I don't feel a need to have any. People, it's hard but it's fascinating how the drawing turns out depending on how you feel about the person. Lesbians, cuz I'm bi and girl just knows what feels good better than a man. No offense, but you know how I mean it. Introversion and piercings and small tattoos. Ariana Grande cuz she has very annoying voice, stupid videos and weird personality. Also, the lyrics of her songs... I don't understand the hype, she seems like a slut to me. I never really made friends because I didn't feel any need have to any, I was adopted by some extroverts or I met them because my mom knew their parents. But if you want to make friends yourself, maybe show them you admire them, you have same hobbies and be open to their opinions?? I don't know, lol. Good luck finding helpful answer, tho. To make them feel good and confident. I wouldn't compliment someone for something I don't think is true, so I am always honest. They judge people by their looks, they only want you to say what they want to hear or they call you when they need your help and when you do your job they don't want to be with you anymore. Try meat alternatives. You can also try other animal product alternatives (soy milk, vegan cheese,...), it's all delicious and you get more used to the plant taste! Sushi and pistachios Sushi and avocados. Bread with butter and tomatoes Physical education. I understand teachers want to lead children to sports, but I never had a teacher who wouldn't make fun of my abilities. Hiding in bathroom on my firts day in the kindergarten. I did that everyday for about 2,5 years because I thought other children are going to hurt me. I was a paranoid kid. A lot of time alone. It's boring for many people but if I could, I would spend whole month at home reading, drawing, watching movies and thinking a lot without talking to people. I love my friends a lot but I need a lot of privacy. 9-13 #176;C So people read my comments and respond to them. Forcing me their opinions and beliefs or forcing me to socialize. With a book or a paper and pencil (or any other art supply, of course) I would have a very fluffy cat and a lots of hair around the house, which is already true (my cat's name is Fluffy) and my brother's rabbit would sing and be annoying (his name is Alvin) Not the worse, but after reading Ready Player One, I was very, very disappointed Tofu, a lot of people say it tastes like a wet sponge. Well yea, but try to not eat it raw Too introverted Telling me to not wear some clothes, like leggins, shorts, two-piece swimsuits,... That periods aren't that regular and you can miss one. I got my third period two months late and I thought somebody raped me while I was asleep and I got pregnant. People all over the world, what is some movie from your country everyone should watch? Why do you think so and what is the movie about? I am usually very, very silent and bad at having conversations, so I am basically extrovert when I'm drunk She realised she is heterosexual. Met my gf. We have long-distance relationship #268;ern #225;, st #345; #237;brn #225; Czech language, means black and silver I had a cat plushie with a little bag on its belly. I would always write my thoughts on a little piece of paper and put it in a bag and I called it a memory kitty. I love it, but I'm kinda picky so I hardly ever finish watching it and there is only few of them I loved. I hate most of the fans around me, annoying weebs. Vegan dishes. I am not vegan but I love vegan food, the plant taste is just amazing (if it's not made with chemicals, of course), but most people around me won't eat food that is vegan just because it has \"vegan\" on it. Like... It's not poisonous, you eat vegetables with meat as well Vegan kimchi burger, absolutely amazing with sweet potato fries Helena by My Chemical Romance Exactly. Soft boiled eggs, boiled 6-7 minutes #128076; #127995; Tamago (Japanese) Short bangs, ginger hair and freckles = perfection #128076; #127995; I'm lucky to date such a pretty girl Lol, I prefer more orange than red hair I didn't have time to paint her nails, so she went crazy. Like very, VERY crazy. I keep my cat in my room anytime I feel like I want to cut myself. I would feel guilty if he had to see me like this, so it usually helps a lot. Also playing with him or cuddling him helps a lot, it makes me feel loved.\n",

            "First time at RTX So I'm thinking about going to RTX London this year as I live in England so London is really convenient for me but it is my first time going to any convention and I'll be going alone. I'm not a super sociable person either. Any first convention tips or tricks I should know? How busy does it get as I sometimes struggle with crowds? Is it worth trying to get VIP tickets? Thank You!!! Musical help!!!! That I have depression and Anxiety. I only had to face this when I was put on antidepressants. I'm scared Hey, I'm probably not one to talk about the social aspect since I'm the one who posted this in the first place but in terms of age I get why that would seem weird. Hell, when I go I'll only be 16! But I don't feel like age will be an issue. Rooster teeth creates content that can be enjoyed by all ages so you going enforces that! Besides, I very much doubt that you'll be the only older attendee there... I'm pretty sure that there are loads of other people wondering the same thing so I think you shouldn't worry about it (she says being a massive hypocrite with an anxiety disorder) and enjoy yourself! I'm pretty sure I'm going to go despite my worries! : ) Birthday painting for my mother I'm currently trying to write my very first musical and I've got the story and characters as well as the lyrics to one song. I'm 15 and live in a rural town in England. I don't have and don't know how to find any actors, choreographers, musicians as I can't write sheet music very well or a location to put it on once I've actually written it! Also if anyone has any tips on writing songs and scripts that would be very much appreciated. Thank you. How? Thank you so much! This is awesome advice and I'll be sure to message you when I need more help! Thank you! \"I'm...\" pen on lined paper I've never been an artist (not a good one anyway!) but I wanted to throw this out there as a 5 minute doodle after hearing my grandmother (who taught me that it's okay not to be okay sometimes) is in hospital again. Thank you very much, luckily I have a few friends that share the similar ideas as me for this piece so hopefully I can go to them for support and a second opinion! \"I'm...\" pen on lined paper I'm not much of an artist (not a good one anyway, might be why this drawing was removed by r/art) but I wanted to throw out this 5 min drawing that I did just now after I was told that my grandmother (who told me it's okay to not be okay) is in hospital. Thank you for your advice, the idea of once I have a complete draft I can enter it into festivals is amazing! I didn't really think of doing anything like that but it would be so good to see what can be kept and what can go! I hope you keep writing as well! I'm a bit overloaded at the moment as I have exams but writing is really relaxing for me so I'll make sure I keep it up! Thank you! Please help Ooh I'll look into that! It sounds pretty good especially since finding new melodies for songs is pretty difficult! Thank you! Advice needed This looks pretty useful so thank you! I'll be sure to watch a lot of musicals especially since they make up most of my life!  #128523; Thank you! Best route? Although I live in a rural area of southern England I'm really scared about the recent terror alerts and attacks. I'm only about an hours train ride from London and I have family in the surrounding area. All this news scares me and I don't know what to do about it. I'm 16 so I can't vote or anything if there were some sort of referendum on the topic. I don't want to be afraid because that's what terrorists want but I don't know how else to react. I'm seeing so many people responding this with hate such as \"ban the burka\" or \"close all mosques\" and I hate that. I refuse to fight fear with hate but I don't know how to feel. Any help would be much appreciated. X After over a month of waiting (as I had to get a different size than I thought due to my weirdly proportioned shoulders) I FINALLY GOT A PROPER BINDER!!!!! I have managed to get stuck in it several times but I am so happy! It's my mums birthday in October and she is absolutely in love with a painting by Jo Quigley that is in the window of a shop in our village; however, it is  #163;349 which we can't afford but I want to save up and get it for her birthday. I worked it out and if I'm really good at not spending money and I have a job by July then I will have enough money in 3 months time. The issue is that I don't have the money now so I can't have the shop keep hold of it for me as I asked and they said I'd have to pay. If you have any tips on how I might be able to get money quicker or ensure that they can keep hold of it for me ( I was thinking of giving them a deposit but they didn't know if they could do that) then I would really like to hear them! I am 16 years old but currently don't have a job despite having been applying for a few months now but I should have one by July otherwise I won't have enough money. Thank you! Chloe. An example of my handwriting, advice very much appreciated especially on how to keep handwriting consistent Unfortunately not, the only job I could do would be babysitting but my mother says she doesn't want me doing that. I'm looking into retail and care assistant roles near me but have been turned down for a few months now. I'm volunteering at a charity shop to get experience so hopefully that will help, Depresseddreamer's circle I am 16 and identify as female but I wear a binder because it makes me feel more comfortable in my body as someone who is very boyish. I have B cup breasts and recently bought my first binder from the internet for a very low price so it's probably not the best quality but I'm saving up to get a proper one by beginning of 2018 hopefully. My problem is though that despite already having the worlds smallest boobs I feel like my binder is too loose and doesn't flatten them to the level that I want them to. Is there anyway to DIY tighten a binder bearing in mind that it is a clasp type one on my side and is very breathable currently to the point that I wonder if it's actually doing anything. Thank you and sorry if this is an off topic question, I'm new here! Chloe x Help please Hello, I am 16 and currently work in a canteen like restaurant in which I serve hot food on hot plates next to and using a very hot pizza fire without proper arm protection (fair to say, not good) I feel that my current work is damaging my already weak mental state as I take antidepressants but because I can't seem to get the job right and I keep messing up its making me miserable. I spoke with my mother about the situation and she said that my generation were \"snowflakes\" and that no one likes there job so I need to \"deal with it\". I also spoke to my college career advisors who said that the environment could damage my mental wellbeing and strongly suggested I seek other employment. I don't know what to do. I'm miserable and self harming again and most days I'm wishing I was dead but I'm getting conflicting messages. No one at my job finds it fun even the managers don't like it there and I would talk to them but they are terrifying. I was taken into the back office yesterday and shouted at because I wasn't wearing my name badge because I forgot it at home despite my apologies. If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it because I'm feeling trapped right now.

            "Anyone remember when Deftones went the reggae (kinda) rout? Xerxes chest rose and fell with the swelling of the seas. \"My lord. We have just lost another archer ship! We must turn back! We could lose the entire fleet!\" \"Steadfast admiral, we push for the beaches tonight, or we die.\" \"But my lord, the ships have just disappeared! If there are rocks ahead we will never see them coming!\" \"Must I remind you the consequences of questioning a god, you may ask your predecessor that question!\" Xerxes voice boomed throughout the dimly lit chamber. The servants and women struggled to keep their bowels, any repulsive behavior could result in death for even his favorite maidens. The admiral left the room after receiving his bearings again. Xerxes prepared his mind for the battle ahead. The Spartans were never easy to put down, and that is exactly the kind of thinking Leonidas was counting on. Leonidas looked out at the sea, at first his men were roaring and jeering with pride and celebration when the Persians crashed on the rocks. But festivities soon turned to debates. The warriors stood at attention at the cliffs, waiting to see another Persian be claimed by the grey blue ocean. It began with a few scout boats, but then the larger ones began to disappear as well. One minute they were there, the next, it appeared the mist took them. The men stood puzzled as Leonidas shook the crumbling earth in one hand, his spear in the other, searching for answers. The men began to sense his worry as well. Picking up on the men's doubt, Leonidas's lieutenant called out to them \"The gods deny the Persians victory! The might of the Spartans are so strong the Persians shiver at the thought of us!\" The men regained some of their lost morale, but everyone knew something was strange. The lieutenant ushered the men back to their posts and dimly walked over to Leonidas. \"What is it?\" \"Its not right, boats shouldn't disappear like that.\" \"And the men know it as well, it would perhaps be best not to let the rest back at camp come to this realization.\" \"hmph\" \"Could this be some kind of new trick, the Persians are indeed a slithering lot.\" \"They aren't that clever, they know they overwhelm us and they know it. Trying to hide their ships would only show weakness, something a Xerxes wishes not to show if he wishes to continue the fiction of his godhood.\" \"Indeed. We shall see come morning, we must gather our strength for the morning, let us return to camp.\" \"I suppose that would be wise\" grunted Leonidas, lifting his shield and using his spear as leverage. The two began down the path, the Persians would engulf their sleep. It was the dawn of the fourth day. If it were not for the occasion it would be heavenly. The summer winds blew threw the Hot Gates, passing through the last of the blooming olive trees and delivering the sweet smell of nectar from flowers buried in the nearby valley. The sweat on the brow of each Spartan reflected the glorious sun that hung hot in a sky devoid of clouds. Seabirds flocked above, catching fish in their mouths fresh from the turquoise sea. Leonidas looked down defiantly from atop a hill. Word had come that the Persians were expecting his forces to disperse. That, of course, would never come to light. But it had appeared that Xerxes waited long enough. A cooler breeze swept through the gates to the relief of the men standing in the sun. It was only a matter of time now. Xerxes had become worried now, but he did not let it show. The fleet had suffered greatly in the storm a week before, the navigators are still puzzled. However it did not matter now. Now only death was on Xerxes mind, that and the burning of Greece. The first 20,000 men were already engaged with the Spartans and the rest were on their way. As his throne reached the top of the brown mossy hill he could hear the sounds of his front infantry engaged in combat. \"Impossible.\" he whispered. From his side, a voice called out to one of the generals. The messengers words reached Xerxes divine ears by way of his most trusted general \"Your Highness, the battlefield brings news.\" \"Speak\" \"My lord, we are getting reports of... beats, rising from the water.\" \"Beasts you say?\" asked Xerxes, becoming intrigued. The poor general struggled to make pace with the bulky slaves march, carrying a God is something you don't take lightly, after all. \"And what do these beast look like?\" \"Well sir, they are a common animal, you may know them, they are said to swallow fallen sailors whole!\" \"What do the Beasts *look* like?\" anger rising in his voice. \"Well, my lord, they are, um. They're sharks my king.\" \"Sharks? On land?\" \"Not just any, it has been told that they carry a device on their heads sir, it carries the power of the great sun god with...\" and before the general could finish his sentence, his head seemed to disappear from his body. A bit perplexed, Xerxes stared at the headless charred body, trying to pull meaning from it, but before he could finish his thought; his throne slowed down as it came over the hill. The throne lowered suddenly, followed by a scream, and another, and another. Xerxes jumped from the falling platform and crawled up to the hill. Where were his servants? His soldiers? Had they not seen their king fall? But this soon became the least of his worries. As he gazed out over the battlefield laid before him, he could only stop and wonder. And wonder he would, until his head disappeared, just like his generals. The world went black. Leonidas watched in interest at the field before him. He could hear the calls of his lieutenant by his side, but instead he simply watched. The lieutenants wisdom would not be needed, he had seen this all before. Laser sharks. Leonidas raised his spear and shield, his red cloak flowing in the wartime breeze. \"Men! Tonight we dine, in hell!\" cried the King. Soon not only would the blood of Persians fill the seas, but that of Laser sharks as well. [WP]You wake up in an eerie abandoned town. You have a note next to you. It says \"5 minutes\" Thanks a lot! I'm more or less new to reddit so this helps a lot! [WP]There is only one bottle of alcohol left on earth. You have it. But everyone else knows you do. Don't worry man! That's was pretty incredible writing! That was an awesome story and kinda want to hear what happens next Dear attractive people. What are some downsides to being good looking? I saw the light burn out from his eyelids. The fiery green stars collapsed under the weight of their own mass, and the vessel fell to the cool hard pavement below.A cool breeze set in as sweat evaporated from every pore of the corpse. The white hot star fire shone down to reap the flesh it had once birthed. I stood and observed this for a long while, trying to comprehend the nature of this drama. Then the ants came, and the birds circled ahead. The once breathing and frantic body was being reclaimed by nature. I stood back from all this, from the rotting flesh, the birds, and into the cool shade, where the same sun that devoured a man could not reach me. I could see its effects on his skin, which began to blister and spoil and collapse, and the smell began to set it. Why? Why did this man fall before me? I asked myself the question over and over again like a madman. I felt the cool soft shape of paper in my hand. Had the man given it to me? It certainly did not fabricate itself in my pal. I opened the paper cautiously. scrawled upon its yellow faded surface were the words One Minute Ten seconds it took to ponder. Another ten to realize. Ten seconds to run down the street. Fifteen to fear the sun. Five to fear the birds. Five to finally see another man. Five to drop dead into his arms. [WP] You are the man who sold the world. Explain to the buyer why you did it Keep up the good work dude! You manage to find a way to hook a reader and immediately build a universe and a sort of mystery around everything, something very few writers can do on the fly. Anyway, great job man :) My Mexican Great grandmother and my Yaqui Great grandfather [Early 1900's] I love it! I've been trying to write some of my own warframe lore myself. This is really cool! Keep up the good work man! What song (or band) made you actually afraid? Three sets of lights danced around the bar. Blue red and yellow sparkled across the crystal bar. The ambiance of clinking glasses and laughter filled the musty old cantina with a sense of belonging. Waitresses made their rounds and news reports sought to suffocate the patrons fun with tales of bloody civil war and the latest galactic scandals. In vain, it seemed, as the multi species concoction stirred within the small and dim hole in the wall. Tales from miners and scouts that had returned from the belt regions swirled with the average office workers drama. The occasional rumbling of the hyper tram rattled the establishment, but rarely spilled the vetted drinkers glasses. Waitresses of all races in skimpy diner outfits buzzed around the bar like olives in Jonathan's cocktail. One of the robotic models whirred over to our table. I had to order for him, he seemed out of it, he had already bumped into a waitress before with his antlers because he wasn't careful. A million apologies and a promised payment for the glasses later he back zoning off. He wasn't himself, where had the usually sly and smooth Jon gone? He was a hit with the ladies, even for a Tarisan. Hell, one time my buddy Jon slept with a Mon Schuti, on a bet of course; no one would touch that any tentacles, except my best friend Jon. One time we were at this herb shop while Jessica was pregnant we had to pick up a medication for her morning sickness, as we were leaving he told me he forgot something in the store, I said okay and he trotted his way back in. He comes out with this slimy bottle of stuff that looked like you left floaters in someones water. He starts telling me that its supposed to increase stamina or something like that, anyway, he convinces my dumb ass to down the entire bottle. I was shitting in my pants for five days. But hey, that was Jon for you. Of course, he wasn't always an asshole. He flew me to the hospital when I tried to OD, that was before I met Jessica of course. The only reason I'm alive today alive today. But this isn't really my story, this is about Jonathan. The robotic waitress brought our order to the table. \"Why the cocktail?\" \"Never had one\" replied Jonathan in a booming voice, he put his hooves through the utensil gloves and begun to shove chowder in his mouth. \"You're eating diner with a cocktail?\" \"I don't see the problem with it man.\" \"Don't you have to work tomorrow?\" \"I guess so.\" \"I mean Jesus man if somethings wrong you should just tell me.\" \"Nothings wrong.\" \"Sure?\" \"Sure.\"He said jadedly.I began to pull away at the fried coruscation on my plate, cracking the red and orange outer shell and stripping the soft gooey insides. I looked up at him, the look on his face was one of deep thought. He had begun picking at his food. \"Have you even been to Esterik 9?\" he asked out of the deep blue. \"No I cant say I haven't. Why?\" \"Ive always wanted to visit there, they have lots of beaches, and the population is relatively low so there's a lot of real estate and great nature areas, i've been thinking about going there.\" \"Would you take Tanya there?\" Tanya was the given human name for his mate. I couldn't pronounce their native names, so Jon and Tanya always had to do. \"Yeah, I think I would, it would be nice.

Bits of meat and what looked to be like cabbage orbited his ladle.

I leaned back in thought. \"I guess. I'm not sure. My whole life I thought I had it all. My whole life I felt like I had everything, that I needed nothing else. I had a Job, great friends, a great station to live in, and an amazing girlfriend who loved me. T believe i thought that was it. That was going to be my life, now and forever. I guess I didn't realize at the time that all I really did was settled for what I had been given. I think back to my dad sometimes man, the things he did, the things I hated him for, the feeling I felt after he died. It changed, it all changed man. I guess I realize now why my father did the things he did because he loved me. He loved me a fucking lot man, especially after I put him through all the shit I did he still loved me, no matter what. I used to think that, that, I didn't want to be anything like him. But we have Jack in out lives and, and.\" \"And what?\" \"And now I don't want to be anything but my dad. I have this beautiful thing in my life now, and I'm going to love it and care for it until the end of time, because he's my son, my very own beautiful son, and I love him.\" \"I think I understand now.\" he said. He got up, pushed in his chair, and looked at me. \"Where are you going?\" \"Tanya wants to name him after you.\" He left. And as I finish writing this letter to you junior. You're fathers ashes are being spread on Esterik 9. He lives on through the white beaches and peaceful jungles of his new home.

Warframe seemed cool and was free so I hoped on in early beta, been here ever since What is something that's wonderful about life? Yes! I've been playing this game since forever and I've been really craving an open battlefield esqe mission. Seeing a fully formed Tenno army on an open battlefield is something that I've dreamed of. Who amongst your high school graduating class had the most successful life? That night, the night that it happened. We stared into the night sky. A lay man could not tell the difference between night and day however. I gazed into the bright starry sky and and features reflected my thoughts like a moonlit pool, blurry and disfigured. I gazed into the starry night and wondered, for the first time in a long while. The luminescent velvet pushed itself in and out of the sky like a labored breath. It's vast expanses of stars and nebula's all on display for a simple creature, such as myself, to sit and gawk at. I sat and meditated in the soft sand, the light of the stars would warm its velvet touch. I let the sand envelop me like an earthly blanket, buried and bathed in endless light as well as the softest sand. The others began to worry about me, they placed their blankets around me, wondering if I had gone mad. I simply stared into the night sky as they cared for me, I smiled. I could watch the expanse forever. How something so large could appear so small baffled my primate mind. Growing up as a child my mother often showed me books of art. I stared at them with similar awe as I did the sky that night. My favorite was Van Gogh. I'm sure you could guess my favorite painting. *Starry Night.* I remember thinking that the mountains Van Gogh painted looked like tree bark, and the longer I stared the more I felt like an ant, crawling to the tip top of the bark to taste the swirling clouds. The stars swirled like these clouds, still breathing in and out, with each exhale they began to grow farther away. My eyes were sore from absorbing it all. I spared my ears over stimulation by letting them fill with sand as I rest my head against the dunes. The swirling universe before me belched, quaked, and finally began to recede back into its corners. It was all rearranged and new. When the universe settled that night there were more stars in the sky than before, they had all been scattered into new locations. I wondered where Orion's belt was now. The night was coming to a close and I could hear a rustling in the distance behind me. A miserable cloaked figure shuffled its way across the sand. Wrapped in layers of blankets like a cocoon. I recognized the brow that hid behind the blankets as my own. My daughter sat beside me and gazed into the luminescence. She curled up and wrapped her gloved hand around the crook of my arm and asked if the others had made it. I told her I didn't know. We were the only ship that landed. After a long sigh and some labored breaths into my chest she rose from the sand and shuffled across the cold dessert and into the belly of the metal wreckage. I finally rose form my perch on the dune, moisture had gathered and cooled the sand below me. I playfully stepped in the footprints of my daughter as I made my way back to the crashed ship. Small lights beaconed out of its various orifices, like fireflies in the cool desert night. I shoved my sore and tired body into one of the man sized holes. One of our friends was cooking soup in a reclaimed communications dish. Our hungry eyes circled around the fire, and our shadows danced against the flickering yellow walls. I shut my eyes for the night. When I reopened them I could see the soft blue orange light of dusk emanating from an old head sized viewing port. I lazily crawled over the other sleeping bodies of leather and nylon in the dark. Outside I saw children look into the sky. I pulled myself out from our family wreckage den and heard the talk of others. I sat down and propped my back against the hull of the ship. Sand was still slithering down our half buried tiny entrance. The awake survivors talked about the center of the universe. How it all collapsed around us. How many more stars there were. I could hear one mention leaving the desert, his friend silenced his idea, we had lost all landing craft in the crash, and besides, we couldn't transport this many people.We were lucky enough that we even made it back to the earth before it all collapsed. He was right. We would bury ourselves like beetles in the machine tomb until our deaths. I blocked the rest of their talk from my ears by burying them in the sand again. And as my head rested on the dune, I turned it to see two children on top of the tallest dune, gazing at the infinite expanse of stars. There were pointing out the black shapes of empty sky. There were so many stars, Man would no longer make constellations, it would gaze at the blackness of the sky; and from this darkness, it would be guided.

            "Insecure Body Shaming MIL I could use some advice and DWIL Nation forums were too mean for me. Let me preface this by saying I don't want to cut my MIL off. I only see her maybe x4 a year because my husband has agreed to limit my contact with her. And when I DO see her its in a larger family setting so I do not interact with her much. The issue is my mother in law brings up my weight CONSTANTLY. I am 153 pounds she is about 190-220. My SIL (her daughter) is easily 250-300. Its become quite awkward for me because she will obsess about \"my figure\" to anyone who will listen to her. Comments include as follows: When I ordered a salad \"Oh wait until you are eating for 2!!\" \"Shes just trying to look good\" to my mother when my mother complimented my weight loss at my wedding. My mother was FURIOUS and hasn't spoken to her since. \"I'm trying to look like THAT\" pointing to me at a family Christmas get together. It was so embarrassing and made her look insane. \"Wait until you have a baby!\" When I lost 10 pounds one summer for my job (cannot say what I do because it will give me away) Then she'll put down her and her daughter \"We only feed the girls in my family\" And what really bugged me is they came to my house last summer (this has since stopped) and my MIL pulled me a side and said \"Can you tell SIL she looks great? She lost 13 pounds.\" She gave my husband \"leftover\" chips cookies cakes and everything she knows I like when I was on a 3 day cleanse. Funny thing was I have IBS and was \"fasting\" on veggie juice to heal my stomach not loose weight. I didn't eat a bite of it but found it funny she assumed it was for vanity and not health. When I hit 153 last summer and she saw me she kept repeating \"You lost weight\" \"You lost so much weight\" and its literally the only thing she talks about. How do I make her stop obsessing about my weight? I've thought about saying \"If you worry less about my body and more about yours you would be happier.\" Or \"Why are you so obsessed with my body? Its f***ng creepy.\" And finally \"If you keep talking about my body, I'm leaving.\" And walking out of the family gathering. Thoughts? Shutting MIL down Family picnic is coming up. Last time I spoke to MIl I confronted her and she seems to have backed down However BILs fiance sent out invites to her bridal shower and I RSVP'd \"no\". How do I handle MILs badgering? She is very much \"Give me an explanation so I can argue with you about it insult you and passively aggressively tear you down about it.\" I have to see her in person for a large family gathering. The Nose in my 'Weight Loss' Has this been taken as a MIL name yet? Mine is quite nosey and prides herself in knowing things about you. Our family get together is quickly approaching and I've lost 7ish pounds due to my job that's mostly walking as well as eating right and regular exercising to self manage my anxiety. I look like I've lost twice that because I'm built like Rhonda Rousey (muscular). She wants to know what I have done to loose weight. Do I owe her a response? If I tell her what I'm doing she will turn it into a competition and I have no interest in competing with a post menopausal woman, especially not the one who [failed to] raise my husband. How should I respond to the \"'What have you been dooingggg's?\" DH insists these are complimentary but for the women out there who have bee through this we known better. I want to say \"Thinking of you and being unable to eat.\" But coming out the gate aggressive will backfire since her team of FMs will be there. Will \"Thank you for the compliment\" work? MIL sent GFIL to Mow My Grass This took place years ago about 8 months into my brand new marriage husband and I had new jobs, new schedules, a new home, and were still getting \"used to\" each other and were fighting a lot. I think MIL smelled blood. She would constantly bring up \"graaaandbabiezz\" and my husband and I would shoot her down. She did group tactics to \"shame us\" into kids at family reunions, run behind the other's back like a child to \"hint\" and when I would tell husband and he would call her to yell at her she would say \"subject280 is too sensitive I was joking about being at her delivery room and having GFIL film it!!\" So now we have FMGFIL. He is MILs father and is basically the Jedi who trained MIL. Hes also the biggest pain in the ads I've ever met. Helpless worthless waste of space. On top of this we had HIS mother GGMIL and his wife MILs mother GMIL. Bot were nasty bitches, codependent on GFIL. Around this time GGMIL and GMIL died 2 months apart. GFIL was naturally devastated and being new to the narc game I DID feel bad. Well MIL smelled the blood and approached husband and I in front of an audience with GFIL in tow and states \"He is just SO LONELY and LOVES to mow grass\" so husband and I agreed stupidly to let this FM into my home where he would bust up our lawn mower, our septic tank, and as soon as we were alone in the kitchen would hound me about grandbabies grandbabies grandbabies. Basically MIL had HIM coming to my house once a week on a work night hounding me for him. Stupid me allowed this for 2 summers. On one occasion he \"accidently\" let the dogs out and I had to chase them over 2 miles because they're hunting dogs. On another occasion he dug for information on my \"weight\" (my MILs obsession) and I finally told my husband \"When we purchase a new mower hes out\" and husband agreed. Now every holiday when I see this shriveled flying monkey he has the nerve to tell me with a CBF \"I miss mowing MY grass\". YOUR GRASS? Yours?!?!? You fucking prune...my theory is MIL wanted husband to move him in with us because we have a step in shower and live in a 1 story home. He was also a school teacher so in their heads \"if they have kids GFIL can be free childcare because they will neeeeed hiiimmm and he is faaaaaamily and sooo loonneeely\" The Time My Husband Flexed His Spine My MIL once tried to guilt us into a last minute party for her father, and we already had plans for the night. My husband responded \"We aren't coming\" To which she whined: \"But its GFIL's biiirrrrttthhhddaaay!\" To which husband replied:\"Oh, then we are DEFINITELY not coming.\" To say it was satisfying is an understatement. The Nose At The Bridal Shower This happened 3 years ago when I first got married. I thought this was the place to unpack it. So I did not WANT a bridal shower. MySometimesNo mother decides I was having one. She, her best friend who is like an aunt to me/mother of MY best friend, my sister and even my brother worked and had food done/games planned in 2 days. My mother calls me and states \"Your MIL keeps texting me 3 times a day asking to help and won't take \"we have it all done\" for an answer. What the  #247;* #247;* #215; do I do?\" Stupid me says \"Ask her to make a dish so she shuts up.\" MIL invites herself to my mothers house to arrange her dish. Of course immediately starts rearranging things and my mom has to tell her several times \"NO\" My parents called me. My Dad who is stoic and usually silent was like \"This woman is a bitch.\" The day of my bridal shower MIL invites GFIL \"to sit in the back room\" since he droce GMIL and GreatGMIL. MIL proceeds to try to make it a day for GreatMIL to get the attention off of me. My friends and family are there all happy for me. MIL is jealous. CBF the whole day. My mothers friend and I do BeachBody workouts and we have both been obease in the past. We were taking about the latest program and my MIL says *to my mothers face* \"Oh...LaneAnie is just in 'bride mode'.\" My mom had watched me struggle with my weight my whole life. My mom gives a speech. Halfway through a teary eyed part my MIL stands up, barks over my mom \"We love LaneAnie too.\" My mom and her friend were speechlessly pissed. GMIL kept mistaking me for \"my twin sister\" I dont HAVE a twin guys!! Gift opening time. MIL snatches every open gift out of my hands to inspect it despite the fact my friend is keeping track of the gift/who sent it. I got a check, guys, she ripped it out of my hands to see how much her husbands realtive had given me/her son! At the end my moms other friend pulls me aside and says \"subject280...What the fuck is wrong with your MIL?\" Reports came back from guests that they were extremely uncomfortable with the way she acted the whole time. And of COURSE weight obsessed sister in law \"Couldn't get the day off of work.\" To bother to come. I strongly suspect she was mad because H and I had been engaged and her long time boyfriend was dragging his feet. My mother says \"When its time for a baby shower MIL isnt welcome.\" MILs Side Get Together Date was set. All of The Boss's nosey flying monkeys are assembled. \"When are you having kids?\" Is all these assholes ask me about.( I wanted to edit this and say I think MIL coaches them to do this. Last year they made a big deal about an old high chair and in front of every one asked loudly if WE wanted it.) My canned responses are \"MIL said it would make me fat so I'm afraid to.\" (Because she has baby rabies this would throw it back in her face) \"When people stop asking.\"(this opens me up to \"we haven't asked where are the kids\" questions) \"That's a strange thing to ask....are you saying I LOOK pregnant? You are SO RUDE!\" (This makes me look insane which furthers MILs narrative) Or I could flip the script. Get them to tell me about their pregnancies and then as they're talking cut them off and say \"Thats nice\" and walk away. MIL in Mauve So...how about \"you will be 3rd to know...after Husband and MY mom know.\" Success Its ALL about control to these people. No SS number no high school diploma no photo ID no record of you and you cant leave. New Daughters I see it as you did your husband a favor by reminding HIM to do something vs doing something nice for your MIL. After all you are his wife.

            "Just found out what I do when I feel anxious is not normal. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Are you saying that you have lines that can be either \"2_label2_1\" or \"2_label2_2\", and that you want to split them by the last character? In that case you could do something like this... val Array(one,two) = scala.io.Source.fromFile(filename).getLines.groupBy(x = gt; -x(x.length-1)).values.toArray Where one is an Array of the lines that end in one and two the lines that end in two.

            "19 and getting an abortion soon. Looking for comfort/advice I #8217;m a 19 year old girl and I #8217;ve been dating my boyfriend (18) since March and we have a great relationship. I never thought I would get pregnant this soon, I always hoped to get pregnant after I got married. We didn #8217;t use birth control but he did always pull out. My periods are irregular so when my period was a few days late I wasn #8217;t too worried but still took a test when I was 4 days late (I took the test on November 7th). When I saw that the test was positive, I was in complete shock, I couldn #8217;t believe it. My boyfriend and I have always talked about what would happen if I accidentally got pregnant and we would most likely go through with an abortion, but there was still a possibly that I would keep it. But as soon as I saw the positive test, I immediately knew that I was going to have an abortion. My boyfriend is extremely supportive and let me choose what I wanted to do. Him and I are both in school and living with our parents and both our parents are very religious and we don #8217;t know what would happen if they knew I was pregnant at 19 or if I had an abortion. We are not in any way ready for a baby right now. Anyways, my boyfriend called a hospital near us that serviced abortions and I talked to a lady that scheduled an appointment on November 22nd (that was the soonest opening). She said I would have an ultrasound, get my blood drawn and other tests. I have been researching whether a medical abortion or surgical abortion would be best but I #8217;m still not sure which would be better. My LPM is October 8th, but I conceived around October 17th-23rd, so I #8217;m technically around 3 weeks. For a little backstory, I #8217;m an extremely emotional and sensitive person, so this is hitting me very hard. I don #8217;t want to have a baby right now but I also don #8217;t want to have an abortion. In class yesterday, I couldn #8217;t stop tearing up and wiping tears away. I know this is going to cause me a lot of pain and grief. I will probably feel guilt for the rest of my life. In conclusion, this is very difficult for me to handle but I know I have to do what #8217;s best for my boyfriend and I #8217;s lives and careers, I also would want my baby to be raised in the best environment possible. If anyone could offer some comfort and assurance to me, I would really appreciate it. Edit: YES I knew that pulling out wasn #8217;t a sufficient form of birth control, I had plans to get an iud very soon. Also, anyone who is not planning on getting pregnant would be shocked as well to see a positive pregnancy test. Please do not comment negativity, I know what I did and I don #8217;t need negativity at this time. Positive surgical abortion experience at 8 weeks Thank you I hope so too I just want to feel better Thank you Pain during sex and cramps and bleeding every day with copper iud I planned on getting an iud but the clinic never called me back for an appointment, I was going to go this past week. Literally anyone who isn #8217;t planning to get pregnant would be shocked to find out that they were pregnant. Fuck out of here Am I the only one who tracks their  #8220;pregnancy #8221; with apps and online? I am thankful that I have an abortion service near me, I #8217;m also glad that I #8217;m in Canada so I don #8217;t have to pay for it. I #8217;m definitely going to try and go to a councillor after this is done with. Thank you\n",

            "I now know who was the inspiration to Ronaldo's Golden Shoe speech Yes that is completely normal! I've had ocd for the last 7 years and comparing my rituals than and now, they're completely different. Most of them still based on counting but very different. I know it's strange because when you have a compulsion you think you'll never get rid of it...but sometimes it happens which can be good or not, because sometimes you just replace for other tic... (at least in my case). Wish you the best (: Does anyone else sometimes \"forget\" why you're doing your compulsions? When I go travelling my ocd gets really, really worse. Last week I was supposed to go on a trip but I got so anxious, I was thinking about all the things that could kill me on that trip for every second I was not sleeping, and my compulsions were on the edge. I touched everything, counted non stop, I couldn't do anything but stay still on the couch crying. So I decided not go on the trip. I also decided to see a psychologist for the first time in 7 years battling with ocd. The suddenly, when I decided not to do something that made me really anxious, my obsessions almost disappear. And I still do a lot of compulsions, counting and touching, but I'm not thinking why I'm doing them, and causes me much less anxiety. I know this is probably just a phase were I'm less nervous and therefore better...but has this happen to anyone? Also, I'm afraid now my psychologist thinks this is nothing serious...but it is... Thank you! Can't stop counting subtitles, words and lines from books Yes!! For example the sound of someone chewing gum kills me but just to see the motion of the mouth makes me wanna punch myself. That also happens for example with someone bitting their nails, I can't stand not only the sound but also the image. And there are many other visual triggers for me...it's great Obsessions with spirits/ paranormal stuff? One of my compulsions is counting and in the past weeks it has been almost impossible for me to watch a movie or read a book. I start counting without even noticing and than I can not stop until I reach a certain number (which is usual big...). I now avoid doing this things since it can become quite unbearable. Anyone else?\n",

            "If only my husband would let me, I have myoclonus and was trying to train my own dog. Chat room Are there any chat rooms out there for people in the US who are having suicidal thoughts or self harm thoughts, to talk to others in the same head space? Not a help line chat or anything like that. I was just wondering the same thing. Why are we always staying alive for other people? Afraid to take the leap for fear of what will happen to others 15 years of friendship, 15 years of fighting to stay alive, 1 divorce, 1 ending My meds have been making me suicidal again, although it #8217;s not really again if it never went away. Being left alone after being so close to someone and even married to them is my breaking point. When the cutting doesn #8217;t help anymore, it #8217;s time to find the right pill combination. I was thinking the same thing as my husband said he wanted a divorce. There #8217;s a girl who calls me mom and every day I get a text saying #8220;mommy please don #8217;t leave me, you promised #8221;. It kills me and breaks my heart. How will your daughter go on without you? What have you done to keep going? You are so young with so much life left to live. There has to be someone who will miss you. Why are you in danger? One of the people I cared about was taken away from me today. The last two weeks have been hell and just getting worse What to do when there is nothing left? In the past two weeks I have lost my husband who wants divorce, best friend of 14 years (husband), my job and today a 15 yr old that I was I guess #8220;mentoring #8221;. She called me mom and pushed me to fight the same as I pushed her to fight. She got baker acted last night and as of what her dad said today I will never see or hear from her again. My doctors see my medication and want to change it, but the last attempt at that left me in an even worse place. I #8217;m massively depressed and my anxiety is through the roof. I have family who are trying to be supportive and friends trying to be supportive. But when I face the facts that I will likely have to sell my horse (my best form of therapy), I can #8217;t really care for my dogs. I don #8217;t want to care for myself. I feel like a waste of human resources and a drain on the economy. There is nothing left to really live for, so why bother. I just can #8217;t seem to find the right mixture even though I try almost nightly. I get how you feel. I #8217;m a burden on my friends, family and soon to be ex husband. I lost my job and can #8217;t afford to take of my animals let alone get through a divorce and I #8217;m too depressed to do anything about it. People always say #8220;you #8217;re not a burden #8221; but it doesn #8217;t change the feeling. Maybe talk to your grandma and tell her how you are feeling now. I #8217;m pretty sure she wouldn #8217;t want you to kill yourself. Because we actually care about the people we leave behind. And the body doesn #8217;t actually want to die. You and me both, sadly I don #8217;t even think we can any disability. Depression and ocd are hard. But it seems like ending it all is even harder. Sadly there will be guilt no matter what you do. Guilt for breaking up, or guilt left after you #8217;re gone. Is it life or the severe depression I #8217;ve been suicidal for years now, I #8217;ve also been cutting for years to stop from crying or to calm myself down. Lately with my life falling apart I #8217;m back to being extremely suicidal again. I say I #8217;m staying for my mom or my friends. But now I wonder am I just too scared to do it? Am I to scared it won #8217;t work and I #8217;ll get baker acted? I #8217;m I too scared it will work and worrying about the people and animals left behind. Is this just another phase of the depression being unbearable? The anxiety doesn #8217;t help at all either, and to top it off psychiatrist are wanting to change my meds at the worst possible time. I don #8217;t care the Benzodiazepines cause Alzheimer #8217;s, it #8217;s only a problem if I live long enough to experience it. My friend and I talk and joke about it bc what else can you really do. So every day I fight not to take the pills at night or during the day. Not to drive my car somewhere and take the forever nap. I keep questioning myself so maybe I #8217;m not #8220;suicidal #8221; but I definitely don #8217;t want to be here and my first thought every morning is #8220;shit I #8217;m still alive #8221;. You #8217;re far from alone. It has a weird calming affect that #8217;s hard to explain to those who don #8217;t get it.\n",
            "Do you live in Nigeria? Making drama for 7 bucks, at least you didn't lose really big amounts like most people. pm link please My parents are as retarded dude. One time I was quarelling with my dad and out of nothing he called the cops and told them that I used some type of drug. Another day I woke up sick and my fucking racist doctor told my parents to have me tested on drugs! Just because I didn't feel good! Drinking the dope?? That last sentence sent me back in time ... I feel you bro :( Hope you'll never end up getting ripped or robbed man, I have never seen such an amount of money in my life because I can't find any customers... Old one from 2016 Suffering from depression I fucking hate my phone so much but if I destroy it my parents won't be able to contact me anymore and since I have pretty bad anxiety everytime somebody asks me if I have any type of social media it really makes me afraid. There's a girl in my class that says she has a crush on me but I don't fucking believe her. She never pays attention to me, never sends me any messages and doesn't seem to care at all. I think she's doing it because she needs emotional support, and that when she's stable again she will kick me out of her life. After having stopped my oversensivity with substances I can assure you that I think it's better for me like this. I gave up on everything and I don't expect anything out of life. I'm completely destroyed, I can't handle people touching me anymore. Be like me, stay home all day. No pain, no feelings. Man ... what an amazing story ... I feel horribly sorry for you ... I think I'm glad that nobody ever got to do the same thing to me when I read this. Is snorting meth once worth it?  I'm thinking about trying meth once in my life but there are a million people saying that it's the most addictive thing ever, that the comedowns are hell and that it will permanently damage your brain. This can't be true right? Lmao Planning on doing the same but I've got a baggie of fucking strong pure synthetic and I don't wanna die. Goodbye dude, hope you have a painless death. Just another worthless day passing by ...  Am I the only one experiencing this? You wake up in the morning after an amazing dream, you think for a second where you are and then you realize you're in your bedroom and not dead yet, and it's gonna be another fucking boring day. You go to school and see those people again that pretend to be your friends, they ask you how you are and you just answer 'fine' like always. When you finally come home you feel tired and empty and you haven't been paying attention to a single lesson. You'll try to eat something nice to feel better, but it doesn't help, you try going outside, but you have no one to join you, you want to study for your future, but you're constantly telling yourself that it's pointless, you want to be busy with your hobbies, but you have no motivation and feel guilty for everything you do. I've been like this for freaking months and even though I visit the psychiatrist frequently those conversations with her only make me feel worse and anxious. I also feel like depression killed half of my braincells because lately I'm having a hard time remembering people's name and shit. If I don't get help soon I'm sure that it'll be the fucking end for me. Oh, well I always seem to come close to suicide whenever life is being a bitch again but lately I've been locking myself up for my own safety so no worries. Just when I thought that someone was finally going to escape from the curse called life. My friends indeed hate me for using drugs and damn I never get invited to parties ... Can't you add any sort of scent to make it taste better? I fucking hate my parents too man, they're one of the main reasons that I'm depressed as shit and only see evil inside of me. I always have to get the best grades, be better than others and they don't fucking leave me alone. And when you ask them why they're doing this they'll respond with 'it's for your own good'. No, stop. Goodbye my friend, hope we will meet one day when this shitty world comes to its end. If you wanna experience death, try psychedelics to make sure you won't regret it. I smoked synthetic weed last month and it sent me to hell. I didn't regret anything and even if it hurt alot I was glad that I wasn't alive anymore. Just a few hours later I woke up and felt like I had lost something. I had a girlfriend and it made me anxious as fuck, constantly worrying that I'm not enough, jealous at everyone that talks to her and in the end I only hurt myself. Don't try it please, it's fine like this. Bye my dude, hope you will get what you wished for. Yes, but I'm not going to commit suicide, I prefer being a life long drug addict instead of killing myself. Re: depression memes  Am I the only person that wants to smash his skull against the wall when he sees another shitty meme about depression or anxiety? I bet that 99% of the people that consider these as funny are faking their depression. Most of the time they don't even make any sense and are very bland. I don't understand how people can think that memes about something they're suffering from everyday can be funny. Showers used to make my day better now they only cause me headaches. How to study when you're hopeless  I'm having finals tomorrow, but after 5 minutes looking at my book I start staring for hours at the wall and I end up in thought loops. I really don't want to fail my finals but I know really good that studying is worthless if I'll end up killing myself anyway. I used to watch alot of depression memes too in the past but I've realized that memes itself are immature and really stupid. Nothing can really make me smile anymore when I'm on my own. Drinking water makes you less depressed.  If you ever looked up for tips and tricks to overcome depression, you'll most likely find people saying drink alot of of water and do yoga. I tried about a gallon of water everyday (4 liters) but I didn't fucking change anything. It only reduced my brain fog but other than that there was no difference. I'm not going to try yoga because doing sports make me very uncomfortable and I can't imagine how it would make me feel better. Lmaoo selfharm.pics isn't working?  Tried to sign up but can't receive confirmation email I really want to access the site but I can't. Beauty in a nutshell. Weird dream.  Last night I was scrolling through Instagram and a friend of mine was chilling with my ex-crush. 1.5 years ago I fell in love with her but she said that she didn't want to be with me anymore because I was loving her way too much. She also switched schools so I saw her less often. Months passed and I did all kinds of stupid shit for her to convince her to be with me, but she didn't accept anything, not even the silver ring I gave her (she told me that she threw it away). Around may 2018 I stopped contacting her and checking on her and minded my own business, but she was somehow always stuck in my head. When I encouraged myself to think of something positive, it was always her, even when I didn't love her anymore. But it didn't make me feel good, it filled me with guilt and sadness. So yesterday when I saw a picture of her I was first disgusted, but when I went to sleep later, I had a really weird dream. We were on a sort of playground. i saw her at the slide and first she looked away, but for some reason 2 of my cousins were there as well (they knew that I loved this girl and they made fun of me). I was talking first with my 2 cousins and I dropped a few jokes, and all of them started laughing. That's when I started to talk with my crush again, and she wasn't ignoring me, but I don't remember what we were talking again, because I suddenly woke up, disappointed that I didn't die in my sleep. Yeah but I always get thin scars that you can't really see I wonder how people get these thick red/purple scars.\n",
            "I had weird surrealistic dream once about a hospital but the doctors jobs were to bring Doritos to the patients. So they would run around the corridors with bags of doritos. It also had a voiceover like an ad and very bright colours. It bought me anti-depressants Never go to the bathroom again. Why was 5 afraid of 6? Because 6 was convicted of the raping and murder of 124 children. I think his throat cancer spreads with the music. A knife I only need the gun to shoot up my school. I get super overstimulated by touch and was always paranoid of tickles to the point where I would burst in tears if someone wiggled their fingers next to me. I'm allergic to bullets.

And then one day I took a kitchen knife and went over and over my skin until it hurt enough. (The blade was hella dull)\n",

            "Ok I'm 18. 5o talk? I just wanna die I've realized there is no way I can life the way I want to and that I'm worthless. There's no point. I know there's NO WAY I can live the rest of my life the way I want to. I'll never amount to anything in the future. I've just wasted my parents money. I'm disappointed in myself. I'm pathetic. Thank you but I wanna die quickly and painlessly that's how pathetic I am I don't have the guts to hang myself I tried sticking my head in a plastic bag to suffocate but that didn't work it just gets so scary that ur body subconsciously gets out of it like my body acted on it's own. I don't know what else to do. I have no future I'll just end up disappointing everyone and myself if I continue to live like this so it's better to just die. It just won't get better I've realized that life is just an endless grind. I thought it would be work hard in high school and relax in college but it's not. It's work hard in college then work hard getting a job then work hard in the job I don't wanna live like that but if I don't live like that I'll be worthless. I'm just worried what'll happen to my parents if I do decide to kill myself they'll start blaming each other and shit and I wanna die quickly and painlessly those are the only 2 things stopping me right now Yeah exactly I'm really worried about my family too but if it gets too certain point then I'll have to jump right now I can only jump from 35-40 feet but I don't know if that'll do it but idk if that'll work. K I'll try to wait till college starts but if it gets bad then I've decided how I'mma do it I'll do it late at night wear an old tight shirt and stuff some glasses in the shirt's chest area landing chest first should be easy if the fall doesn't kill me then the blood loss from the lacerations due to the shattered glass definitely will. THANK YOU EVERYONE #10084; F for respect If u had 125 mil souls u probably also had aged feather so why use darksign Ohhhhhhhhhhhh PREACH!!!! #128591; #128591; It was good but I didn't like the art style and the stakes in that one weren't that high also. Comedy anime  Please suggest me a comedy anime like gintama #128591; #128591; Thanks alot #128578;! I've seen saiki and mob. I'll check out arakawa under the bridge Yeah I've seen it. It's REALLY funny but not as funny as gintama some gintama episodes will literally make u laugh till ur stomach hurts and I haven't found any other anime that can do that except for a few scenes in Beelzebub and Saiki. Lodhu gintama dekha hai mainea tabhi like gintama likha hai post pea tmkc Seen it Thanks #128578; I'll check it out Which country are you from? I just finished high school and cleared Entrance exam for vets. In my country some medical colleges are heavily subsidized so fees is like 1,000 dollars for the entire course. Anyway these colleges are very hard to get into like acceptance rate is 2%. Anyway animals are my whole world and I entered this profession because of animals but can I make enough money to live comfortably alone as I don't plan on having a family? Lol this is what y'all are paying hundreds of dollars for xD Name? PERFECTION INCARNATE Don't make it weird Took me 50 hours in first playthrough so it wasn't short for me. I played it too much like souls coz I have 2,000+ hours on souls I pretty much beat the game without deflecting on second playthrough I learned deflecting and it was much easier I hate myself  I hate myself. I'm fucking despicable. I don't wanna kill myself coz it'll make my parents feel sad. But I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I hate the way I act with everyone around me. I'm almost 19 I'm 5'10 and 48 Kilograms. I hate my face I hate my body. I hate the fact that I'm jealous of everyone around me. I'm not good at anything. I've recently started punching stuff coz the pain gives me satisfaction but I can't do it as often as I'd like coz everyone asks questions about it and I can't think of more excuses. I tried cutting myself a few days ago it was kinda fun but not really thrilling. I don't know. I just hate the person I am right now. Everytime I see myself in the mirror or in a picture I'm just disappointed and angry. I hate everything I do. I don't know why I'm like but I wish I was different. If I were you I wouldn't love me neither. Thank you for reading I just wanted to vent to see if it would help. Have a nice day :) I hate myself  I hate myself. I hate the way I look I hate my voice I hate the way I speak I hate the way I interact with people. I've always hated myself but lately I'm realizing how pathetic I actually am and now I just love punching walls. I started a month ago. I love the rush I get while punching and I love the pain I feel after. I love seeing bruises and blood and I love the scars that come after. A couple days ago I like dislocated my tendon. I loved that too it was like a new injury. I'm a college student everyone asks what happened to your hand I just lie to them it's not like they care anyway. I wanna get hurt really bad but then I'll get caught. I tried cutting myself between 2 knuckles but it was just painful. There was no satisfaction so I'ma stick to punching walls. I just wanted to share this because I could relate to a lot of ppl on here.\n",

Ethernet is always the way to go. i used to have ping spikes / ind spikes in mostly overwatch before I got my Ethernet cable. Its butter smooth now and I highly reccomend it because your ping will lower to the 20-30 #8217;s from 60-70 #8217;s. my best friend constantly complains about her WiFi struggles because of it being wireless (and the cheapest plan, haha.) so ive learned how to remedy it even if it #8217;s slightly. if you cant move the router or yourself closer to it your best bet is ethernet, yes. new ryzen 2700x owner! few questions  i am pretty new with ryzen, my last pc had a i7-6700 in it so I have some questions about it and it #8217;s performance. Does the cpu automatically overclock itself with default bios settings? I am not currently interested in OCing the 2700x with the stock fan. with default bios settings my CPU #8217;s EDC spikes to red during idle. is that normal? Is it normal for the VDDCR to be 1.4+ consistently? I #8217;ve seen it hit 1.5 occasionally on stock bios settings. My cpu stock fan #8217;s speeds whirr and tone themselves down pretty quickly whenever I #8217;m idle or browsing through the bios. it is pretty annoying. is that a normal occurrence of the processor? would it be worth investing in a aio cooler? i am using the latest bios update and my chipset drivers are up to date as well. Thank you for your patience as I try and wrap my head around this thing! okay. thanks! ahh, I see. Out of curiosity, what is exceptional cooling by your definition? how much lower temps are you averaging with one? i tend to get high temps with it on. Buuut I will surely test it out if I can get better cooling for it someday so I don #8217;t cook it haha. ahhh I see. thanks! Anyone wanna play pc ow  :D? CST i cant log in either T___T its very disappointing!! lmk when you can be on next tho :D this is very exciting! hey! Can you link me to the discord? yes! it sort of makes me feel disillusioned with life sometimes if that makes any sense. its kind of scary being so forgetful, sometimes stirs up my anxiety pretty well. it was very hard for me to sit through intensive classes like calculus because everything just went through my head. Yes !!! do you pm the server address or something? AIO cooler for ryzen build  can anyone here help me find a good AIO for my ryzen 7 2700x? I plan on upgrading to the next ryzen series as well. add me! #65351; #65353; #65362; #65356;#1809 people told me that too; but depression hit me like a rock and I #8217;ve come out just like you have. things just fly over my brain Cuddly baby aussie baby aussie p2 Is that actually bearhands sr tfw people forget about the objective he has transcended into a higher level of being. oOo RCK has ascended you #8217;re therapist is a little blunt, huh? im numbing to all of this  My mom has not learned. I am 18, I #8217;ve spent most of my life taking care of her, my little sisters and dealing with the aftermath of her relationships. I have not had time to go to college or live my life. My dad has not been in the picture since I was 13, so me and my twin sister have been playing parents to my two little sisters. The most recent one has been the hardest. we will call him Hoover. Hoover got dishonorably discharged from the military, brags about fucking a girl and her mom in highschool, talks about my little sisters inappropriately and blackmails my mom whenever she tries leaving him. he is literally scum on earth. the man has nothin going for him since he #8217;s 50 and just lives off of the state because of his PTSD. He is not a stable man. In January my mother attempted suicide. I do not want to go into detail but I will say I was the one who found her and called. The night before my moms suicide attempt I was arguing with her because I did not want my little sisters to move in with hoover. I was afraid of their safety and I did not want to risk them going through any sort of misery because of this clearly unstable man my unstable mother loves. I have been struggling with accepting that reality is real. my mother goes on charades of saying how much she hates him to saying how much she needs him in her life. this man has a calendar and dishes out time for her. I can say so fucking much about this man that just resonates an awful feeling within me. he had me and my sisters sit and listen to him like he was a drill sergeant essentially telling us it was his way or you #8217;re never seeing your mom again. I was pissed, and I still am extremely pissed with how controlling this man is. Im sorry if this all makes no sense. I am beyond baffled and it hurts me so much that it #8217;s hard to write out coherently. He will not go. all he does is have time because the state provides for him because of his ptsd. whenever my mom tries breaking up with him he sends her documentary length film episodes of texts and emails and calls her on different phones when she blocks him. it feels like there is no escape. He blackmails her with legal documents and sends her pictures of documents filled out against her. I am so crushed, I don #8217;t know what to do. can I join?? was i supposed to laff jokes on u i just woke up at 5pm and did nothing oh cool. thanks! i feel like I am running out of #171; #160;distractions #160; #187; or whatever you call them in this post. just a tiredness and not much making me happy anymore. its incredibly sedative i love to bottle up my feelings and facing them just makes me want to run away from them. whY is the world ending soon? no i havent heard :/ i dont see meaning in life or things in general so I don #8217;t bother to watch the news lol. that all sounds thrilling, glad I was born in this universe hey, wanna talk? which is why I don #8217;t understand why it #8217;s a big deal now. Global warming has been around for awhile now. we #8217;re all going to die someday. why stress over the inevitable destruction of mankind? not like many of us have or have had a say. i dunno dude. I watched my mom seize in her bed ODing off of countless pills. maybe it would be easier to just die when the planets gone to shit. im a 3.9k hitscan player, but im 19 :( ahh I gotcha! I have a bunch of accounts because I like to onetrick and flex, so feel free to add #65351; #65353; #65362; #65356;#1809 and CHIDORI#31131 im pretty self destructive too. wanna talk more about it? can they stop things don #8217;t feel real  ive been struggling with life feeling unreal ever since i saved my mom from her suicide attempt. a few days earlier I watched my grandfather pass away as well and my mother attempted suicide two days after his funeral. It was pretty rough for me as the oldest of four. I #8217;ve always struggled with mental health problems like anxiety / panic disorder and I am a massive insomniac. i feel incredibly slow and careless and I can #8217;t be bothered to do shit about it especially since things don #8217;t feel real and I feel like I #8217;m in some other world. nothing makes sense to me. i like to sleep away life, but I #8217;m also an insomniac so it #8217;s pretty ruff that honestly makes a lot of sense. like you just become so unbothered that you cant even be bothered to plan a suicide are Your temps consistent without PBO? to be honest your best bet is to stay away from him. try and not agitate him, it is in your best interest and for the sake of your sanity. get an aio if you want significant improvements, I had used the wraith prism and it #8217;s really trashy honestly. I don #8217;t think people treat mental health like breast cancer awareness at all. just with many communities mental health is PRETTY taboo actually. no one wants to admit there #8217;s something wrong with them, lots of people go without the help they need because they don #8217;t want to be looked down upon or treated differently by some individuals. everyone to some degree wants to be normal and to be accepted. there is slowly a culture shift on acceptance happening, but its a slow process yknow? I was mostly speaking from experience and from how the people around me act towards mental health. lol wait a year I still think you should wait especially if you live with ur parents lol, people slip with sex toys all the time and it is from my friends experiences the most awkward shit haha explain I used to use 7cups and I #8217;ve never had a good listener from there. they end up talking about their life stories and I end up being a therapist for them. its not what I came there for and it #8217;s a waste of my time. i told my mom I was suicidal and she told me #8220;join the club #8221; lmfao this has been pretty hard for me to deal with, especially since I had social anxiety prior and whenever I try and crawl myself out of that sort of mindset I have this innate fear of people and allowing myself to be vulnerable so I just want to crawl back into it I don #8217;t want to feel anymore  I hate this soul crushing pain and hopelessness and I want it to leave my head. I #8217;ve been desperate trying to get into hobbies and things but nothing has eased my mind or changed the way i feel, if anything it #8217;s exacerbated it. i want it to leave so badly and it scares me. I #8217;ve never understood those types of fetishes lil puppy I #8217;m not sure. she was my old neighbors dog aussie snoot plat is extra interesting. nope, nice try communist. it almost looks like the bear minimum specs. you won #8217;t have a super enjoyable time but it should run. I #8217;d try flushing your dns. see if it puts u back to west. if not then welcome to the best coast bitch. Route 66 sucks I #8217;m curious, have you optimized your pc or the game at all? see if you can go back to the nvidia drigers from 411.70. Quick play has a mmr system so technically you are facing people your own rank. I #8217;m not going to lie I got myself drunknvecause I loved the way it makes me feele instead ofb that, butj I #8217;ll try thnk u Try reverting the graphics driver. to like version 411.70 You #8217;re trying to isolate yourself so no one gets hurt when u decide on milking yourself. I am the same way, please talk to me. Killing*** didn #8217;t realize what u had,sirry I get you. I just drink, I don #8217;t do anything else because alcohols the only thing in the house I have easy access to. its easy to get addicted to things when your heads fucked. this morning I woke up feeling the same shitty way I felt when I fell asleep so I just ended up drinking it away. I don #8217;t have access to therapy or proper meds. I hate how I push away my friends and girlfriend and I don #8217;t know how they #8217;re still here and what it will take for them to just leave so I can disappear quietly without any reciprocation. It feels terrible, I don #8217;t know if it gets better. but I wanted you to know that you aren #8217;t alone with these feelings and if you ever want to talk about shit more ill listen. sure. I detach from everything and just blast music and lay in bed. i get uneasy and I just want to not exist anymore. that #8217;s not true lol she is my life tbh my babye I am convinced my drivers are messing it up as well, @___@ Whats ur OC? cuddley babey lots of people cheat to gm, then get banned. sometimes it takes awhile babye table top boye have u disabled it in the device manager? your system should not search for drivers if its unavailable. just curious because sometimes people just disable it in the sound panel and not the device manager and it doesn #8217;t always stop it. deer leggys soft could be a mental breakdown?? sleepy bean alright, let me know! hey, try reverting your nvidia drivers. to 411.70 Soggy boye lol honestly I #8217;d be surprised if they don #8217;t take advantage of this. atleast give Hammond a soccer ball skin as well. you don #8217;t have to be mechanically skilled to climb in overwatch, it is a team based game. if they excel at something else like gamesense and shotcalling they should do jus fine. so long as they aren #8217;t on aim intensive hero #8217;s. I #8217;ve seen many people succeed though. lol depends, if you #8217;re tilted to the point of no return take a break :,) otherwise you might perform terribly. yeah! it counts the game as completed and gives you the rank you #8217;d have gotten if you lost the final placement even if u come back. pretty interesting lmao No if u win, but if you loose games in the lower elo yes. depends on how good u are at doom ngl i mean besides the noise i kinda see where ur coming from but it personally doesn #8217;t bother me that the animations are similar. its really easy to tell when an orisa dropped her bongo and that it #8217;s coming from the bongo. I feel like there would be too much visual clutter if orisa had a distinct animation for the ui itself especially if you #8217;d get boosted by a mercy as well. sometimes consistency for similar actions is okay. ive seen people leave in any rank, I don #8217;t think there #8217;s a direct correlation with rank and dnf statistics UNLESS someone is intentionally deranking. I mean maybe people get frustrated when they can #8217;t aim or something while they try and force overwatch to run on their toaster, otherwise I #8217;m not really seeing it. tbh with you I don #8217;t really notice much of a difference player mentality wise bronze thru low plat. I just wouldn #8217;t sweat about it and perform as best as you can. might as well since you can only sweettalk your teammates to success only so much haha. LMAO UR DIRTY a colorful scribble thoughts on medication as a form of help?  My mental health has become pretty destructive to my daily life and I am pretty self destructive in general. i am not medicated but I am diagnosed. would it be worth trying to take meds for my head? my mother has always been pretty anti-medication which is why I #8217;ve always been weary, but i am sort of at this #8220;fuck it #8221; mindset at this point to try anything I haven #8217;t. storing it for later :) table top snow eatin were u lagging? hows your internet connection? NZ servers might be down, which is why it #8217;s forcing u on US I get that, but it sounds like this happens a lot to you. if that #8217;s the case, has it only been happening recently or? o ok doomfist rendering device lost is on your end. try reverting nvidia drivers if u have a nvidia gpu to 411.70 and prior or make sure all ur shits updated. I #8217;d stop playing come first of all, you know your risking games for not only you but your teammates as well. try fresh installing maybe? dog comes home from vet. sees things in the wall wait what? I #8217;m confused. how is jojo a bad thing? please explain more if you can. there should be an option to disable voice in icue. maybe it #8217;s in the same spot for firmware updates if you remember where that is, i haven #8217;t used it in awhile since my void pro broke but I strongly remember being able to disable it. I feel that, I used to not like darling in the franxx because someone I don #8217;t like was obsessed with zerotwo. I watched it, stopped associating her with it and my life is much easier because I tried my hardest to stop associating her with it and to not let her inadvertently affect me. i know it #8217;s hard to move on from someone who hurt you especially when things they like reminisce in shows and whatever. shows usually don #8217;t reflect on people #8217;s behaviors, I promise jojo won #8217;t make people bad friends to you like that one dude. happy grass boy no. be a battle mercy. i can send u many of my potgs from diamond+ battlemercying wait what? Did u record it? wtf orange I didn #8217;t read the other comments I #8217;m sorry LMAO LMAOOOO I never said I lost those games nice essay but, I am a gm dps player and I battle mercy on smurfs whenever I want to because its fun and it would be silly not to encourage it. I #8217;m not saying do it all the time silly, take it with a grain of salt all you want lol it doesn #8217;t really matter too deeply to me. hopeless  I keep relapsing pretty badly and it just gets worse and worse each time. I hate my head more than anything in the world and I #8217;m sick of how self destructive I am. I #8217;ve ruined so many opportunities mostly because of my mental health and it just builds up man I don #8217;t do anything with my life other than blast music and occasionally text friends and sleep and I #8217;m hardly motivated to take care of myself anymore. bork I #8217;m so sick of panic attacks.  I #8217;ve had a lot of them and over the years and they #8217;ve gotten different. I didn #8217;t notice them first as panic attacks and I thought I actually had been clean for a month or two because I was used to them appearing in different ways in the past. but I hate the absolutely overwhelming nature of them. I hate having one at night because I still feel those feelings of dread and deep anxieties when I wake up in the morning sometimes and sleeping it off doesn #8217;t cut it. I just want it all to end. same here, I can #8217;t even drive period. I #8217;m 19, I #8217;ve never gotten my license. they are insanely debilitating and I wish I was normal more often than I can count so I could have done the things I enjoy. I don #8217;t think you #8217;ll get much internet points for this I #8217;ve started talking my dog out for walks in the mornings  its a little thing, but it #8217;s helped my head a little bit. I have a hard time motivating myself to do pretty much anything, normally I freeze up pretty badly and give up and I spend a lot of my time just laying in bed or sleeping. but today and yesterday I was able to get myself to walk my dog across the field from my house and it felt really nice. hard time opening up  I am a perfectionist and it drills me how imperfect I am. Its hard for me to let myself be vulnerable and talk about the #8220;imperfections #8221; of my head like my depression without fear of how they #8217;d treat me any differently. It #8217;s genuinely pretty scary to me. I don #8217;t think you should leave her if you guys both love each other as much as you say. it looks like she is actively making an effort for the better, and that she is in a rough spot right now. getting therapy in itself can be very hard for people to deal with. i want you to know that I gave my mother space and she attempted to kill herself in that short time period of me thinking backing away would have benefited her more than not. I am an unstable person as well, the least you want to do is leave and I realize that now. space isn #8217;t a bad thing, but being there constantly could be overwhelming to her if that #8217;s what you guys are thinking. if you back away for a bit make sure to let her know that you #8217;re still there if she needs you, even if it #8217;s just a little text it can really go a long way. oh AAAAAAA  AAAAaaaAaaaaaaaaaaaa churropractor sometimes bad internet drivers will cause this. try reinstalling them Oh yeah man. its pretty wrenching. I cant even open up to my romantic partner about it right now without shying away, I never could properly with a therapist and it just leaves me feeling very frustrated and sort of helpless. I know it sounds a little contradictory but I sort of freeze up and cower away from the idea of letting them know completely. vulnerability scares me like a plague. I used to lie to one of my therapists, say I was participating in hobbies and such just because I never wanted to admit that I lost interest in most things for a long time now. it took me such a long time to open up to her about pretty much most things. Sometimes it #8217;s easier to talk to strangers about it, but a therapist becomes a sort of acquaintance. exactly, I don #8217;t want to bring her down with me either. I know I #8217;m a lot to take in. sometimes I #8217;ve said some things here and there, but it #8217;s still incredibly hard to not want to emotionally run away from it all. thank you though. for what it #8217;s worth I #8217;m going to try and get a professional to help me again, you #8217;ve opened my eyes a little. my mom constantly puts herself through terrible boyfriends who always abuse her. I #8217;ve had to help her through all of the shit I #8217;ve lived to see her go through like a little pocket therapist, including her suicide attempts. I want to know why too. Facebooks media servers are down right now. me u should have gotten a #8220;you tried #8221; or an #8220;attempt was made #8221; achievement do you have a ssd? Hdds tend to load pretty slowly from my experience. I don #8217;t think there #8217;s much you can do about load in time in that regard with a laptop. facebook and instagram are run by the same company. if facebooks servers are down then so are instagrams. where did u end the season before? sometimes it depends on the time of day. how many people are on. no, season 11 or whatever you said. did u play any games after you placed? that #8217;s why, it doesn #8217;t place you based off of where you placed initially. it places you based off of where you ended the last time you played comp. man I love me some long necked chicane god I want some of those back. I used to do it because my head was so fucked up and I just wanted to feel something. TWO!!! wasp r nasty tasting no its just wasp. I refuse to believe there is more than one I like to say my twin sisters dog is mine because I take care of her during the day when my sister works night shifts haha, but I think it would be very good to have my own dog someday. that means I have to work for it, and it sort of gives me a spark of motivation but I can never usually ride it through it. I never noticed how much dogs helped people emotionally before its fair to feel indifferent about them, people die. that #8217;s just how life works. you fucked up dude. Apologize. you should! trust me. :) it #8217;s worth it. guys how many times do i have to tell you. theres only one wasp. oh no  I want to curl up n a little ball of non-existence saaameeeeeee no one to party with, so I #8217;m on the Internet lol samme im 19 too its pretty killer :7 I was mute for many years and I had terrible panic attacks that left me really avoiding people for a long time, but it gets pretty lonely I am curious  sorry if this is the wrong place for this, but why doesn #8217;t the United States pick a president who is moderate? why do they have to pick sides? In theory wouldn #8217;t it be better to pick a candidate that both sides could agree on and keeps both sides in mind when making decisions? Or is that just me thinking wistfully. i bought a refurbished acer xf250q and the bottom of the panel flickers when set to 240 hz the flickering goes away when gsync is enabled. is that normal Lol??? you #8217;re essentially paying a premium for the x570, if you really want all of its flashy features than go for it. what #8217;s ur peak sr no, it is muscle tension I promise. you just become hyper fixated on it after a panic attack and hyperfixafion IS normal with anxiety prone people. unsub different types of panic attacks?  i used to have these attacks where I would hyperfixate on my breathing and hyperventilate and I #8217;d focus on my heartbeat and swallowing and convince myself I couldn #8217;t swallow and it was not a fun experience, however it #8217;s been a year or two now since I last experienced a panic attack like that. I didn #8217;t notice these as panic attacks at first but I think I #8217;ve been having less severe ones with the unwanted thoughts, heart racing, trembling shit etc. I mean I #8217;m glad I #8217;m not hyperfocusing anymore. what is th #233; invisible name character? yeah, I feel that. I get myself to believe that I will get myself to stop breathing, it #8217;s not a fun experience to accidentally impose on yourself. I hit a standing still widow how to play candy crush saga you can actually place much higher with placements depending on your performance. contrary to popular belief. ok smartass, unfollow it yeah, thought you were being a smartass. how are you getting notifications otherwise? e_e no like you seriously can, I #8217;ve had accounts where I was in gold and I #8217;d place high plat/diamond the next season. winning doesn #8217;t always net large sums of sr. the game factors in a sort of win streak bonus as well so if you consecutively win placements and not loose games in between you #8217;ll get a whopping amount of sr per win. It also factors in performance, usually k/d and that sort of things like damage blocked or healing per 10 depending on the role you play. Especially if you #8217;re playing on hero #8217;s with high win percentages. The game will try and balance your win percentage out by placing you in higher elo games. idk, I just work here yes u can. idk it was in the custom games, maybe you #8217;ll catch it. usually it #8217;s called widow hs something, I #8217;m at a festival so I can #8217;t check but you #8217;ll be able to find it im sure. omg gamers away from the game. a very rare situation! Yeah, the regular castillo or chateau ones are just called widow hs but I swear these ones are called like widow hs ___ something I don #8217;t remember off the top of my head lol. rialtoooo? maybe take him back lol bye you're not really preventing smurfing, you're just decreasing the likelyhood of smurfing on fresh accounts. 75+ would deter a lot of newbies as well. there would probably be more of a market for higher leveled accounts on igvault or wherever. not really, it takes 24 hours to get to level 25 when theres no xp bonus events. thats a lot of time to people with full time jobs. well sure, I #8217;m not talking about bad onetricks. but contrary to popular belief quickplay isn #8217;t really a grand place to learn heros for competitive. personally I started this game in silver and playing against smurfs opened my eyes to new playstyles and tactics and I would like to credit as one of the key reasons I was able to climb to gm. If you want to improve at this game competitively tossing yourself into competitive is the best thing you can do for yourself, really. well congrats on 2.4k hours in dota, but ow and dota are two different games. yeah, if you wanna get better at competitive you have to play competitive. quickplay has very little to no structure its not going to teach you how to climb very much. god I #8217;m a messssss  :) I don #8217;t really know what else to say at this point, just a lot of hurting people aren #8217;t understanding that quickplay wont teach people competitive very well. forcing people to play that shit for what, it takes about 24 hours to get to level 25 solo. so it would take around like 67 hours to get to 70, maybe more because I believe you need more exp the higher level you get. that #8217;s a lootttt of time doing garbage. exaactly I have been one of the dps players and the solo healing ana, it is pain. wtf noo. most people don #8217;t take quickplay seriously. U wont be able to learn the hero competently. why do u think there #8217;s so many mercy mains who play widow everywhere else? or plats who wreck at widow ffa? they just don #8217;t have the game sense. most of the times it #8217;s because they don #8217;t know how to play widow at the level they play mercy at. if you want to learn heroes competitively u gotta play comp. im not talking about the basics. I #8217;m talking about the gamesense you gain from playing competitive. exactly, which they #8217;d learn from playing competitive. sure, but if your intent is to learn the game competitively the best thing you can do for yourself is to throw yourself into comp if you want to learn quickly. some people have all the time in the world, other people have full time jobs or college courses. i know not everybody likes getting thrown right in though, everyone #8217;s different. some people wait, others don #8217;t. you can #8217;t expect to place very high your first placement either way, but you can learn to get out of there through grinding competitive more efficiently. I think its in the nature of quickplay itself for people to throw. people prefer to get high or drunk in quickplay than comp because there are no punishments. but that in itself depends on the person lol, I #8217;ve met many drunk ppl. honestly if they had a sort of competitive readiness game-mode where it teaches people the basics of competitive I would really like that. well yeah, I started in silver, 1900 myself on my old toaster pc. I feel like smurfs helped me learn the game better quickly, not all of them are sitting there wrecking noobies. some Smurf #8217;s actually introduce team compositions etc and help point the team to a win more efficiently than someone in silver might not know exactly, which is why I credit it to helping me climb to gm. Sure it #8217;s not fun going against a smurf in low elo, but I think it should be taken as a learning experience, seeing how they rolled you sort of thing and using it whenever u can next time to roll more people and climb out of elos. you #8217;re not going in totally blind. as I #8217;ve said, getting to level 25 in itself takes about 24 hours of game time. something to teach game compositions would be neat, overwatch doesn #8217;t really explain that to you when you get first introduced to the game. It would be neat if there was a #171; #160;meta introducer #171; #160;sort of thing. th #233; higher level you reach the more exp is needed for the next level. blizzard doesnt do 1k per 1 level. yeah! ow #8217;s little tutorial in itself is nice, but it only really teaches newbies how to play soldier sort of. and we all know soldier isn #8217;t really the only thing to this game lol. Maybe if they revamped it and elaborated on things new people might not get off the bat it would serve more of a purpose than it has currently. more like passing fire no stopppp I dunno if it should record coms honestly, some people wouldn #8217;t like that stuff recorded. I def understand for scrim purposes though. really excited furball I #8217;m not just talking about you, cutie. poor gegi you would definitely need people to consent to it, that would be a nice little feature. a really pretty mutt maybe? : D read the other comments :) I think she missed, I dunno what grav negation is all about CCwatch (: guys there #8217;s only one wasp. how can they even exist enough to eat then wym??? that entire r/ is a SCAM try and not fill as much. if you #8217;re playing characters your not decent with or flexing too much you #8217;ll really mess yourself up aw you thought you were special. :* cc stacking is so fucking tilting. its called sarcasm, and it clearly doesn #8217;t play well with you. no ones attacking you? are you thick skulled? we been known yas cant really give you the best, it #8217;s all personal preference. sometimes people can get so depressed that they want to die but don #8217;t even have the motivation to kill themselves.\n",
            "I just distract myself using any means possible - YouTube or sleep are my favorite distractions. Me too. I feel like I don't fit in even in so-called \"safe spaces\" where everyone else seems to make friends so easily. Honestly one of the reasons I'm still going is because there's always books coming out that I want to read. Can't read if I'm dead, so... Me too - even on good days when I'm waiting for the train I think, well I *could* theoretically throw myself under it, but meh. I see rafters and think about hanging myself. It's less of an emergency than something that just happens and I don't really feel the urge to act on suicidal thoughts. Kind of awkward when I don't look before crossing the street and my friend jokingly says, \"I'm a college student who just got an assignment back, run me over!\" How'd you know what I was thinking? Public transportation. Plus I don't have friends so I have plenty of time. Learn and read and definitely enjoy school more. I would learn every language I could and specifics of historical events. Requiescat in Pace. November 9 by Colleen Hoover. I don't think I hate a book more than I hate that one. Reading. It's excellent on public transportation. I've had severe social anxiety and depression since 7th grade. Six years of being a teenager and I've spent most of it at home in my room, I don't even remember what I did most of the time. I made a couple acquaintances that weren't really friends. I missed my prom and after-parties. I've never had a group of friends before. I'm in my first year of college now and my social and emotional growth is so stunted that it's difficult for me to connect with anyone. \"What's up?\" I never know how to answer. I'm 18, still get children's menus at restaurants. Got yelled at while walking in Paris for seemingly no reason. I've told people who aren't my parents, and most of them said, \"It's probably because you're Chinese.\" On the plus side I'm the only person my parents know who didn't have anything stolen while in Paris. Me too. I've always been shy but in seventh grade I was bullied, generally by exclusion - people would act like I wasn't there and talk about me behind my back. I knew what was going on and they knew I knew what was going on. I just kind of stopped talking to anyone after that. I moved schools the next year, but that came with a healthy dose of severe anxiety that the same thing would happen. I had one friend at the school from before, but I didn't talk to anyone else. I was invisible and to me that was better than knowing I was being ridiculed. Rinse and repeat every year and now it's so bad I can't talk half the time I'm supposed to. This happens to me a lot too, because one little thing triggers doubts which after a while turns into \"I'm a failure of a person\" and then I just want to sleep for the rest of the day. It's ridiculous really :/ I'm probably gonna end up not studying for two big midterms I have in two days. I'm the opposite, I'm terrified of not knowing that I'm dying. Even if I can't do anything I'd rather just know. I had a period of a few months once where I barely slept because whenever I would start getting tired I'd start thinking, \"This could be the last time I go to sleep.\" Not in a hurry to relive that (though I guess it'll be a while hopefully lol) I'd rather go the assisted suicide way - then I'd know beforehand AND not be lucid when that happens. Scared shitless of failing out of school, disappointing my parents, and having nowhere to go in life. I have social anxiety. Talking to people, asking strangers brief questions, ordering food, e-mailing people, phone calls, are all hell for me. I stutter when I talk because I'm so nervous, so I try not to talk much, and as for e-mails - I have to ask someone to send it for me (I write them out and have someone else press the send button because I can't do it) In my experience telling someone in a bad situation \"it gets better\" doesn't help. At all. I'm fine being anonymous on social media. Not fine with emails to people I know. I did that in one of my classes, but the teacher was an expert in talking incredibly quietly. :/ Can confirm. We also bitch about Quebec and Saskatchewan. I'm game for all Christmas carols. I was fourteen and in the library reading when this college-age guy came up to me and started talking to me. (I'm short and look for my age, so he wouldn't have thought I was even in high school.) Anyways, he ended up asking for my shoe size, and puzzled, I replied. He asked if I could double-check, so I took my shoe off and I did, and while it was off he picked up my foot and started feeling it, talking about how he was an artist and needed to know for an art project. I was pretty naive and unassertive at the time so let this go on for about a minute growing increasingly uncomfortable and creeped out. And then I looked at his face, and he looked really excited. Pulled my foot from his grasp, put my shoe back on and ran off after that. It was really fucking weird. Always. Doesn't help that I've had a great childhood and supportive family, it only makes me feel worse because I should be glad my life is so great. I always feel like I'm pretending to be depressed so I can continue being lazy. Frankly, it's ridiculous. But if I was really just lazy and not depressed, I wouldn't feel so guilty about it, I'd be happy about all my free time and put it to use instead of not wanting to do anything. I'd play video games all day instead of feeling too awful to even enjoy video games. I wouldn't think about dying all the time. I wouldn't feel like I was a piece of shit for going to therapy and wasting people's time. I'd be elated about pulling off a deception, but I'm not. So. I guess that's how I try to convince myself. Still. It's irrational but I guess that's the nature of the illness. Best: Harry Potter Worst: Westeros I did until I had three back-to-back 75 minute classes over lunch hours. I'm still uncomfortable, but I'm hungry, dammit. iPhone charging cords. I just lie down in my bed and watch YouTube/Netflix until I fall asleep.\n",
            "Tell him it #8217;s better than going into an overthinking spiral and going crazy. If he likes you perfect if he doesn #8217;t atleast you #8217;ll have closure.Also the guy sounds smart enough not to end a perfectly good friendship over something like this.Good luck #128077; #127995; PS I have a crush on someone so I can totally relate My crush is a dead end most likely but I really hope it works out for you and maybe you are what makes the guy change his mind.I am a bit of a fairy tale person so I apologise if I am being way too optimistic but good luck #128077; #127995; The lady was doing my eyebrows and her hand slipped which gave me shitty thin uneven brows and I had to go see my crush with those eyebrows and also attend the college fest.Perfect timing #128522; Since it #8217;s already messing up your head bad I say go for it.You already said you can #8217;t keep doing what you already are and maybe she feels the same and if she does that would be beyond perfect and if she doesn #8217;t atleast you #8217;ll get closure and stop the overthinking spiral.Also you don #8217;t necessarily have to end the friendship after confessing your feelings. It #8217;ll be 11:11 am on the opposite side of the world not 11:11 pm Epic show cartman is funniest Do I take a break and not text him.I am guilty of mostly texting first. Yeah we have been talking daily.Today he joked about a snap that he put and said things I do for love.I know he doesn #8217;t have a girlfriend but could it possible he is considering someone else?He told me he doesn #8217;t have time for this way before I told him I sort of liked him. Never He lives in a different country.We recently met when he came home but it wasn #8217;t a date or anything like that. Yeah I should do that Thanks #9786; #65039; I think that too but sometimes he would flirt or do something which actually make me think he actually cares about me and I get confused everytime. Well we do live in different countries lol but I do get your point.I don #8217;t think he sees me as more than a friend.Thanks #9786; #65039; Yeah I understand.Really thank you so much though #9786; #65039;.I #8217;ll try moving on.I mean I have to.Thank you really #9786; #65039; Like telling your crush you like them #128522; Uni is somewhat suicide in itself I haven #8217;t seen him in like 2 months.He came home a while back and we hung out in the gym a few times but that was pretty much it. What if I do tell him and he says no and then I end up ruining this friendship too or whatever in hell this is? Totally agree #128175; He won #8217;t be here till next year I guess and even then if it isn #8217;t the country issue it might be the religion issue or the age issue (he #8217;s 25 I #8217;m 21)or simply I am just not what he wants.He says that I shouldn #8217;t expect anything from him so what #8217;s the point of putting yourself out there when I already know the outcome.Trust me I wanna do that and get a concrete answer and move on.But I am just scared it #8217;s gonna be a no and I won #8217;t even be able to move on.I mean who is stupid enough to have a crush on someone since 3 years. But isn #8217;t it so hard maintaining this friendship?I am always checking if he has seen my messages or if he seenzones me or ignores me it breaks my heart.We live in different timezones.Its almost his bedtime by the time I wake up and vice versa but still somehow I feel I would be ready to risk everything for this one guy.I just don #8217;t have the guts to tell him cause I know the answer is gonna be no.If you think there is something and it might be yes maybe you should give it a try.Maybe we should give it a try. I sometimes think he likes me.Its really weird and complicated.I had a crush on him when he was here but it was one of those crushes where you just look at the guy and smile.I didn #8217;t even know his name.I found out a year ago added him on Instagram and we started talking but he lives in a different country now.We talk daily.Sometimes it does feel like he is into me but it #8217;s really confusing and he always says not to expect anything off him so there is really no point in my case.But if you think something can happen with your crush I say you go for it.Even I told this guy I had a crush on him once but then laughed it off and it was stupid.At this point I am considering clear cut telling him that what I feel for you is really strong and I can #8217;t keep talking to you and be friends hoping maybe one day you #8217;ll fall for me. You are not a bad friend if you have feelings for him.Don #8217;t mess yourself up over this.You can do this. It #8217;s like this short story I read in high school Case for defence by Graham Greene Mine #8217;s halfway around the world and you sir have given me a lot of hope I told him that I like him and can #8217;t keep talking to him and hurting myself.He said same told you not to expect a lot and somehow this is his fault too.I really don #8217;t know what he meant by the fault thing but we have still been talking but I don #8217;t know what I should do.Do I keep talking and like totally forget everything or do I stay strong and not talk? Thanks for being so supportive #10084; #65039; I really don #8217;t know how I feel but I am relieved he clearly knows now.No mixed signals or confusions.But he sometimes acts as if he doesn #8217;t give a fuck about me and other times I am the first person to know when anything good or bad happens.Makes me question what I exactly am in his life.This is why I told him in the first place but I still have so much uncertainty in this matter.I mean I know a relationship is out of the question but then what am I? Even prior to telling him one day I am his best friend other day excuse me who are you.So it #8217;s really confusing. When you talk does he keep the conversation going or is mostly you asking the questions and trying to talk? I am really sorry but that #8217;s not a good sign.It was like this for me too but I have learnt from recent experiences that if someone wants to talk to you or be with you they #8217;ll make an effort to show it I so need this It looks like that cat from that cartoon show which I can #8217;t remember who was an alien Totallyyyyyy Oh yeah it was kid vs kat The theme music is playing in my head as I am typing this lol Make your own notes especially of the stuff you find difficult.I am not sure of your syllabus but we had various cycles like ketogenesis,cholesterol synthesis etc and they took a lot of time to memorise.So it #8217;s best to make notes or something like that for it.Some teachers do prefer their notes but if your information is right they can #8217;t ignore that.Take someone else #8217;s notes and just look once so that you don #8217;t miss anything important that #8217;s only given in the notes. Finals start in 10 days and I haven #8217;t even started studying  I am in med school and my finals start in 10 days.We had send ups last month.They are like exams just before the finals to help us prepare for the real thing.I haven #8217;t studied a word after send ups and I just can #8217;t seem to focus.I waste too much time on my phone or overthinking stupid stuff.There is a lot of stuff that I couldn #8217;t cover during send ups and planned to do it now but I just can #8217;t focus and study.Any tips? 4 subjects, 10 days and I plan to start preparing for the first one a couple of days before finals start.And my unhealthy phone addiction.I hope I make it.Thank you #9786; #65039; If people weren #8217;t procrastinating and wasting all their time most of the social media and memes would be non existent. Don #8217;t cha worry.When the time comes I won #8217;t kill anyone We #8217;ll see about that.I ain #8217;t dying or killing anyone yet. Okay I give you this one #128079; #128079; #128079; I simply meant we don #8217;t prescribe medicines YET I tried that.Went for a couple of days without instagram and Snapchat but then broke down and downloaded them again.I might give it another try though.Thanks Really pathetic and self degrading Why am I not good enough for him?Why not me? I know it #8217;s really stupid Social and preventive Medicine I made it Don #8217;t worry you can do it too #128077; #127995; That #8217;s exactly how I feel.Legit the same feeling.But what you are saying is right.If he doesn #8217;t care then what #8217;s the point??? My friend texted my crush who I had been talking for quite some time and who kinda knew I had feelings for him that I was ready to marry him and have his kids.So I kinda get you.I think you should chill now and see how he reacts after break.Tell him it was a stupid joke or maybe you thought he was kinda cute and it #8217;s nothing.Try to keep it casual and cool. I made it yayyyy #127881; Thanks for the suggestion.It really helped. I made it through the finals so yayyy I have never been in a relationship but I have seen someone very close to me be in one.You know it #8217;s abusive when there are more fights than you can even remember.Its abusive when he tries to control every aspect of your life,when he considers you his property or some possession,imposes restrictions on you.Bottomline when he doesn #8217;t let you be you.When he doesn #8217;t let you hang out with your friends cause all your time is his time. Imagine being in that situation even without being in a relationship with the said person. The worst thing though I can #8217;t even think about being with anyone else.And this guy did make me feel special.It wasn #8217;t all in my head.Also I am 21 and he #8217;s 25 so the parents aren #8217;t the reason he isn #8217;t responding.He moved to a different country a couple of years back and he came back this year and totally surprised me.He made up some silly excuses and then he was like surprise I am home.We actually started talking when he had already moved to a different country. Yeah I get that.And I get the parents thing too.Where we live parents play a big role in deciding who we date and can have as a partner and he is from a different religion.Frankly I don #8217;t think I have a chance and I am so tired of trying.And he lives so far away.Maybe that #8217;s why he didn #8217;t want anything.Either ways I know I gotta stop.I just don #8217;t know how. I know but it #8217;s so hard.I can #8217;t even imagine blocking him.Isn #8217;t there another way.Also it #8217;s really petty but I do want him to see if get with someone else.He knows how much I can care and love someone.I want him to see me doing it for someone else.I know it #8217;s incredibly petty and stupid and unhealthy.And I don #8217;t wanna do this cause he didn #8217;t reciprocate my feelings.Its cause he is still playing with this knowing exactly how I feel.You must think I am pretty stupid by now. That is actually a great idea.I should do that.Really thanks. All I do is study and workout and gym just reminds me of him.No kidding you actually reminded me to have a life. That #8217;s another thing.He had abs and I was fat.I am leaner now but not slim.But he never made me feel fat.Before I started talking to him I never thought a guy like him would even look at me.I had serious self esteem issues.I had friends that said look at him and look at yourself but he never made me feel like that.Not once.And I watched him stand in front of me getting all shy and finding words to talk to me and I see him now being a total ass.I am sorry I am ranting.I am gonna try and cut him off.I know that #8217;s the right thing to do.Thank you so much. You totally get it.I tried so hard to impress him.Picked up hobbies he was interested in.Cared for him.I would make sure he was up for his job,took medicines when he was sick blah blah and he is nothing to me.He isn #8217;t mine and will never be and I should move on.And frankly I am tired of trying to be good enough for him.Tired of trying to get him to talk to me.I should rather focus on myself now.So thank you for that. Blue smokey look God I feel so powerful Who said I barely made it? I did better than that.Thanks for the suggestion though.Don #8217;t know how you live with such negativity inside you You think I am dumb enough to not care for my patients.First of all I am a student and not a clinician yet.I kick my ass studying the entire day something really tough.Its natural to be paranoid and to get too stressed or used to the monotonous life.Yes I wasted some time before my exams but that doesn #8217;t mean I didn #8217;t study before.I passed really tough exams to even get into this college and it wasn #8217;t all a fluke.I wouldn #8217;t have even cleared the first year if all my life was a fluke.Sure you have concerns about some doctors but all I am saying is when I put this post I was stressed out and losing focus and not that I didn #8217;t study everything beforehand or that I don #8217;t care about the field I have chosen.I am already preparing for the field I wanna specialise in and doing research work all on top of my regular classes. If you still think I am joke I can #8217;t help it. You don #8217;t even know my result.I had 10 days to go for finals.And I had given send ups.I said I hadn #8217;t studied anything after send ups.I have studied regularly for a year.Of course I wanted to revise whatever I had studied before because everything is tough and you tend to forget so many symptoms and disorders. I have a long complicated crush story too.But I am afraid mine is reaching the end. Dude that #8217;s amazing.You #8217;re seriously so lucky!!! My crush hasn #8217;t even seen my text I sent hours ago and we have been talking for over a year.Low key jealous of you but it #8217;s great to see atleast someone is getting lucky or some romantic shit out there.Good luck with her #128077; #127995; I think it is.Its been quite some time since I visited Singapore but I went to Switzerland a few months back and from a tourist view point it is very expensive but the beauty of the place is totally worth it. My case is a little complicated too but thanks.Hoping to get a text back before I fall asleep.Its way past midnight anyways or maybe I should sleep.Whats the point anyways.Sorry I am rambling.Continue your date #128077; #127995; #128077; #127995; #128077; #127995; Ohh I am a girl waiting for my guy to text back.Its day where he lives so yeah.Could be busy.But she fell asleep next to you.Thats soooo cute.I am legit squeaking at my phone.Sooo adorable.I wish I could fall asleep next to him. Thanks for your support but your situation is so cute.PS the girl is pretty lucky too.You seem to be a nice guy.Good luck with your relationship #128077; #127995; Which movie btw? Try to take a break one you get tired so that you don #8217;t get too tired.But try to listen to music or take a walk or something for break.I tend to waste a lot of time on social media during break.Like the 10 min break suddenly becomes half an hour.But that #8217;s just me.Good luck #128077; #127995; I can feel this so much.If he hasn #8217;t given you an answer you need to move on.It sucks and quite frankly even I don #8217;t know how to do that.But you need to.You need realise your worth and realise you deserve way better. My mom has threatened to disown me on multiple occasions and I still won #8217;t learn #128514; Medical textbooks can get real tiring real fast cause there is so much information to memorise.I am a med student too.I suggest you make a plan of what you wanna accomplish in the next one hour or even 20 min and keep your phone aside during that time period.You #8217;ll feel a sense of accomplishment and will keep doing it.Thats what I usually do.I also tried deleting a couple of social media apps during my exam to help me focus. I did that too I am med student too but the books clearly say that the method has a very high failure rate.Especially compared to other methods.And in general condom also prevents infections and STD especially if you have multiple partners. That #8217;s what I suggested but she #8217;s deeply hurt and want him to suffer. May sound a little creepy but look at her social media.If she has a boyfriend she might have posted something with him. Yeah go ahead.Good luck:) I don #8217;t have a chance with him but we #8217;ve been texting for over a year now.He #8217;s so Cute and so damn adorable.Never listens to me.Elder to me but still sometimes acts like a kid.Takes my breath away when he walks into a room.He #8217;s always very confident but gets all shy and nervous when he #8217;s talking to me in person.He can be a jerk too sometimes but I don #8217;t know why I still love him very much.he always calls me kiddo even though I tell him not to. One of two things.Either he likes you and is too shy to admit it.Probably wants you to make the first move.Or maybe it #8217;s nothing.I have been in both situations.This one guy had so much eye contact with me and even showed interest the one time we talked but then suddenly changed overnight.So I think you should make the move.Atleast you #8217;ll know. Ocean blue eyes looking in mine I think I might sink and drown and dieeee #128525; Marrying my crush There are a lot of reasons.Age,different religion(where we are from it #8217;s a major factor) etc etc but what should I do?Stay friends or tell him I can #8217;t and end it? When I confessed I told him I can #8217;t keep talking to you cause it hurts too much and I failed miserably.I always knew that nothing can ever happen between us but I hoped it somehow would.My story is long and complicated and I would love to tell you if you are interested but I am finding it so hard to give up.At one point it all seemed destined to be. Nope I am 22 he #8217;s 25 about to be 26 Why do creepy uncles at the gym have to pull up their shorts to look at their hairy non existent adipose filled quads when clearly they are sharing the same tiny mirror with some girl young enough to be their daughter.And the staring.I mean come on.Atleast respect your age.This one time I confronted one and he didn #8217;t even fake deny it.Picked up his jacket and left. Trust me no body says that.The guy I confronted was following me around the gym.Everywhere I went.And I could always feel his eyes on me.So he #8217;s a creep.You are in a room with so many people and mirrors.The occasional eye contact is natural but you just know when someone is being a creep. Exactly.Sometimes I do avoid if they are actually too old but if get the total creepy vibe from them I sure go upto them. Medicine surgery Peds gynae.Will rock my final year.Though the number of pages I would have to eat would probably give me some sort of chronic stomach condition. What is your most embarrassing gym story? I once spilled water all over the treadmill.The guy next to me offered his towel to clean it up. Not the same but I started taking off weights from the barbell only from one side and when I removed the last one it flew up into the air made loud thud and everyone came running.So embarrassing. This scene has my heart The thing is we actually never happened.For a year and a half I made him my everything but turns out I was nothing to him.I knew every little thing about him like some pseudo girlfriend. A friend made this and I figured it belonged here This scene has my heart.Pam #8217;s smile when Jim asks her out and she that lip bite her total expressions basically are one of the finest things we have been blessed with in life. I volunteered for pulse polio campaign a few months back as a medical student.People were really supportive.We collected the data for MR campaign along with administering OPV and it #8217;s well accepted in the community That #8217;s a big thing.Especially regarding the recent MR campaign. whatsapp and media were full of shit like it #8217;s not good or whatever without thinking how essential it is for the health of children and doctors take all precautions while working with needles. I totally get it.I have never been in a relationship and everyone around me is in one.I am 22 and have never been with anyone.Everytime we go out all my friends dress up for their special someone and send them pictures and there I am looking in the mirror with no one to impress.I help them choose what to wear for their dates,hear their stories with no story of mine.And I am girl.Girls can be alone too. I need him to be my personal trainer Were you dropped on your head during childhood? Family goals.I gym so I can do that one day. Burn the onions-Kevin Malone Thanks I have been trying to get over him and love myself but I feel it #8217;s so tough Thank you so much.Its been really hard lately. I am only using insta and Reddit too.I just happen to have so much free time at this moment that it #8217;s tough to not think about him.I still try to stay distracted. Congratulations #127881; I legit saved this to post when I finish med school. He isn #8217;t on insta but yeah you are right.I spent so much of my time and energy on him I can put that to good use. This is so relatable and it sucks.No point in wasting your time and energy on someone who doesn #8217;t care. He tells you upfront.There are a lot of signs which can indicate he likes you but sometimes assuming stuff can hurt you real bad.I know I have been there.Till he tells you clearly he likes you don #8217;t assume anything. I am really sorry.Guys can be real jerks sometimes.I have been through all this.Infact I am still going through all this.If you need someone to talk to dm me anytime but stay strong.There is definitely something better for you out there. He #8217;s been really rude and the last time I texted him he replied after a day and a half.That hurts even more than not texting. Exactly.Then I #8217;ll have the anxiety of whether he really does want to talk or not.Its been so many days and nothing from him.Thats a message in itself. I am sorry I already know he #8217;s gonna say I am taking time off social media or whatever.Last time I texted him he replied after a day and a half.Might as well not send him anything. Hope things get better for you. Nah already sick of this life why would I wanna make it infinite Holy shit that #8217;s the worst.It would kill me.My crush has played me for way too long with these mixed signs that I am so tired now. Loving you is hard cause you are you yet I still do it anyways and beyond measure. I meant your own legs and doing compound movements at the gym. See you gotta focus.Think that you have to work your ass off this week and you don #8217;t have time to cry right now.You can cry as much as you want once you are done with exams.Keep your phone aside and just get to it.Realise you don #8217;t have time to cry.Thats what helped me go through finals week.I went through that exactly.But you have no choice than to study. He was my senior.He would always treat me a little special but I didn #8217;t think too much into it cause we were very very good friends.He wanted a picture together at the college fest but he had to leave a little early so he called me up to ask me where I was and I told him never mind we can take it next time and then I realised there would be no next time and this was it.That was the moment I knew(It was the last year of his college). It just got messy.He kinda got together with someone else and we lost our friendship too.He said he liked me but then talked about kissing someone else and got into a relationship with another.So I guess he was just confused and I got caught up in it trying to figure out if I read the signs wrong or he just couldn #8217;t make up his mind. It #8217;s natural.Just try focussing.Keep your phone aside or whatever it is that #8217;s bothering you and get to work. Need to start somewhere I hate those people.If it was upto me I would slash their Tyres lol. I am 22from India.Love the office.Got my heartbroken,lost people to death too.Medical student so know something about medicine and forensics.here if you need me.Ohh and I am a girl. Don #8217;t trust anyone.People are damn good at deception. Khabib training moves I kinda wanna post this on Instagram lol Why ofcourse Dwight did I have had marital fights with my crush who won #8217;t even acknowledge my existence anymore Anybody know which episode is this from? Thanks :) My feelings for him I have been in your place once and even though I am quite comfortable at the gym now I am very demotivated and don #8217;t do shit.I am totally in :) Read the stuff over and over again.Relate things practically.Depending on the proff you are in.Like if you are studying anatomy focus on diagrams and try to correlate with what you saw on the cadaver.If you need any help let me know.I am a final year med student. Spoiler alert:-Reading it and memorising it still hurts a lot Wait till you read about the extensor compartment of the forearm or the calf muscles or the sole of foot.I have cried actual tears for them #128514; Meeeee But that doesn #8217;t mean that they are actually mean or unapproachable.I suggest you talk to her.Take an advice or something if she #8217;s better than you.Dont be creepy but take your chance.I know exactly how you feel,being attracted to someone #8217;s determination.I missed my chance so I am telling you from experience try to make a conversation or something.Get to know her.Be a little charming.Take a chance. Need help urgently  I am new to After effects and need to get the hang of it asap.My senior asked me to make a video of it which is to be released tonight at midnight.Any help will be greatly appreciated.Tbh I don #8217;t have the time today to watch lengthy tutorials.I just need to know the basics a little bit. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds :) This is gonna sound real dumb but what is keyframe? I have never worked with this.Infact I just finished downloading the software 10 min ago. I have half the video ready.I need something like a boom announcing our project.Any idea how to do that? And the boss thing she #8217;ll boom me if it isn #8217;t good. You are absolutely right.I have been myself all morning.I managed to make some text explode and now I am using windows movie maker to finish it off.Thank you so much for your help :) I know.I am sorry.I was just so confused with this and had no idea where to start.I figured it out a little bit and now I am working with the stuff I know to make something good.And yes it makes me wanna kill myself so your RIP might come in handy. I am not dumb.Why would I say that?She told me about the software in the morning and I said I #8217;ll look into it.I just didn #8217;t wanna give up without giving it a fair try. I am gonna do that next time.I can #8217;t do this especially without any help or training.I am gonna tell her to hire someone next time. Beating those superior species whenever they invade the earth. You need to tell her.You are killing yourself anyways.Its been a year now.Maybe she #8217;ll like you back or reject you but atleast you #8217;ll know for sure.This emotional turmoil would end and you won #8217;t have to keep wondering. I didn #8217;t mean to offend anyone here.I was just looking for help.I didn #8217;t wanna let anyone down but I told her it #8217;s not my thing and I can #8217;t learn it so soon so she can hire someone else or be happy with what I make.I didn #8217;t make any false claims .I was just hoping for someone to help me cause I was so short on time.Thanks for your help :) I #8217;ll give it a try.Thank you so much #9786; #65039; We had been talking for some time.He lives in another country but then he came home and totally surprised me.He just texted me come here I am home.A few days before he had to leave he stood in front of me and his eyes told a different story.He was shy and smiling and looking for words to keep talking to me.That was it .That look on his face,his eyes,that #8217;s when I fell for him. Perfect.Thats the word I used to describe him too.But work on yourself and believe in yourself.Thats the most imp thing.Don #8217;t stress too much.Things have a weird way of happening. Yeah make a move.Doesn #8217;t matter if you are a girl.Take the chance and have no regrets in life.Its always better to know if the other person feels something so that you are not wasting your time. That #8217;s so true. Most guys approach women who look approachable or someone who #8217;ll likely say yes easily according to them.Looks obviously help but it #8217;s more of how guys perceive you. The way he folds Quite possibly the reason my mom wants to disown me but I love the chair.Priorities right. Falling in love with the wrong one I so needed to read this.I am going through something exactly similar and the story is exactly like a fairy tale right from the moment I saw him and we hit it off so well.Even though we just text(he #8217;s in another country too) I can know what he #8217;s thinking it or if he #8217;s upset just like that.I don #8217;t know the exact reason why we #8217;ll never work out but I know we won #8217;t and I should work on myself first. Thank you sooooo much for writing this. Everyone has feelings... Guess this one in the million too No one should drink and drive.If you don #8217;t value the one life you have been given enough atleast think about the people you leave behind and what impact it can have on their lives. You need to change how you spent your breaks.I used to waste a lot of time on social media and my 10 minutes break turned into hours.I deleted it and it helped.Try to keep your phone aside.Maybe listen to some music and walk around a bit when you take a break.All the best #128077; #127995; I am not entirely sure of your test pattern but practice numericals and derivations again and again.Try to do different type of numericals.Like instead of doing 10 questions of the same type try to do 10 questions of different type so that you can solve any problem.Also focus on the reasoning questions.Again not sure if your test pattern but hope this was helpful.We used to get numericals and derivations of formulae a lot. Yes.Her boyfriend is too controlling.He demands to know where she is at all times,she has to take his permission before going out or even attending a class she wants.He even decides when she can go and see her parents and gets mad if she stays home too long as their relationship is secret and she can #8217;t talk too much when she #8217;s home.She doesn #8217;t see it cause she #8217;s dumb.There is one thing being blinded by love.This is whole another level of bullshit.She is also not allowed to spend too much time with her friends.And he can spend hours with his friend and not even pick up her call.Thats no 1 boolshit. Ohh I forgot for light do the ray diagrams nicely.Thats the easy part.Waves is the tough part.Practice that more. Please re rack your weights.Don #8217;t just leave them where you were working out. Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick Thats what I thought.It doesn #8217;t take her two minutes to turn on me and be back with her boyfriend so why do I kill myself caring for her and thinking of her well being. This might not be the best advice but maybe you should talk to him.I mean if he reciprocates your feelings then perfect otherwise you have solid reason to move on and it #8217;ll be easier.Also just like you I have never been in a relationship in 22 years of life waiting for the perfect one but now I am thinking that maybe I shouldn #8217;t be so uptight and give it a chance.I mean if it #8217;s meant to last it will otherwise it #8217;ll be a lesson.All the best #128077; #127995; Tbh this post made me a little hungry but yes get to know him.Maybe he does like you.It seems so.This is a very cute story and could be the start of something amazing.Just be prepared for whatever may happen.It does seem like that he likes you but even if he does make sure never to question yourself.All the best #128077; #127995; My stomach is actually throwing a temper tantrum as I am reading this.So needed to see this. Blush a little.Its alright.You #8217;ll look cute. Kevin is a sweetheart They have each other #8217;s passwords.As long as they are together he #8217;s gonna check her ID.All I want is for him to atleast not open my texts.I can #8217;t even send her any meme or something he might find offensive.I guess I #8217;ll just stop texting then. It #8217;s more like I don #8217;t want him to know what #8217;s going on with me.Like I went through some personal stuff and opened up about it to her.Shes #8217;s my best friend.She can share anything she wants but the stuff that even I find hard to admit to myself I admitted to her and I didn #8217;t want him to read that.I can #8217;t even send her a simple meme or anything if he finds it offensive even though she might be cool with it. That #8217;s exactly my point.I am pretty sure he read the personal stuff too.Thats none of his business.I know my friend respects my issues enough to not discuss them with him and her relationship is complicated and kinda toxic.So I don #8217;t even say too much. We stay in the same hostel so usually we hang out all day.Since we were home for the holidays texting was the only option.She doesn #8217;t use her phone too much at home so calling her is not a good option.Also as far as a wedge between us is concerned he is the reason we are not that good friends now cause she keeps choosing him even though he cheats and is abusive. Exactly.I have decided to handle my own shit myself.As far as the cheating and abuse is concerned I have tried telling her so many times.Its her choice what she wants in life. You mean for your love? I think I might prefer dehydration. Lol just kidding man.I love all berries though blueberries are my absolute favourite.Too bad we don #8217;t get them were we live. They aren #8217;t married.They are far from marriage.The guy cheated.They have had each other #8217;s passwords since the very beginning but few months ago he changed his,refuse to gave it to her and then she changed hers too.Even though she eventually found out that he cheated not once but like thrice she got back with him. You have no idea how many times I have tried.When she recently found out she had old me to talk to him and I literally told the guy to fuck off and leave her alone.Then she told me she wants to give him another chance and I tried to convince her then said it #8217;s either him or me.She said she won #8217;t talk to him but kept persuading so I finally gave in provided he won #8217;t abuse her.But now I see her ignoring me cause of him and then saying I am the one walking away and even took his side when I confronted him and told him to leave her alone.You have no idea how shitty I feel right now. I don #8217;t know what to do.Her birthday is coming up and I wanna be there for her.But I hate being ignored.One thing is for sure that I am not giving her any advice or anything like that.The worst thing is I have been with her through everything.All fights,problems,every damn thing and now she says you are not in a relationship so you don #8217;t understand.Just basically rubs that in my face and that felt so bad. Yeah yeah.See we are still friends.I feel like we are just not as close as we used to be.Since we practically live together we spent a lot of time with each other.Her family is practically my family.Maybe all this is in my head.We have been away at home and I haven #8217;t seen her in a while.Maybe I am in a mental competition with her bf.I feel like she takes our time to talk to him but doesn #8217;t even drop me a single text.I know all this sounds really stupid but thank you so so much for listening.I really appreciate it. My thumbprint is on her phone lol.Thanks for the advice though.I think that #8217;s what I #8217;ll do. I wish to study in UK.I study medicine in India.Maybe I #8217;ll do my masters there. I know you don #8217;t.The last time I was talking to a guy I liked I realised my cheeks were flushing.Then I looked in the mirror and I looked kinda cute lol.Thats why I said. Helpful mostly In case she is committed to her boyfriend and is in a serious relationship you just have to suck it up and accept it.I know it sounds harsh but what #8217;s the point of beating yourself over something that might never happen.Just stay low and give it some time.Also this sounds totally contradicting but maybe try to get to know her a little.You have never talked to her.Maybe she isn #8217;t what you want but you don #8217;t even know it yet. It doesn #8217;t matter if you #8217;re a girl.Go for it.All the best #128077; #127995; People who are in love always find their way back to each other and end up together. Ohh and also if a girl likes a guy in a movie the guy always ends up liking her back in a twisted meant to be scenario Always get so hungry watching that movie Currently watching season 7 and feels like Harvey will date anyone but Donna  No doubt his relationship with Dr Agard is good but he and Donna get along so well and he knows how good he #8217;s for her.She is exactly what he needs and for some reason all through these seasons he #8217;ll date anyone except Donna.He isn #8217;t even her secretary anymore and he can give it a chance.He can #8217;t even see how much Donna likes him and cares for him or he chooses not to. Like I am actually watching Donna be hurt right now when he reveals his relationship to her and I feel her man.Donna loves him so much but Harvey will run to every other option than Donna. Holy shit now I realise how sleepy I was when I wrote that lol.But still she is what he needs and he can #8217;t see that. Why do you think that? Why shouldn #8217;t he give that relationship a chance? I am not really sure of your grade system.We have an entrance exam for med school but I was in your position once.I struggled with physics.I thought I couldn #8217;t make it.So I spent all my time doing numericals and working on my weak points.Again I am not sure how much time you have or when your admissions start but if you put your mind to it and start working you can do it.I start my final year of med school on Monday so it is possible as long as you believe you can do it. I guess.I might have been projecting my life onto them. People call me nurse even though I am a doctor just cause of my gender.I don #8217;t know why males feel doctor is a superior job which can only be handled by their own kind. You can put a little oil on your spoon to prevent the honey from sticking.Just a little over the surface works like magic everytime. He wasn #8217;t.I wanted to play on the word jiu jitsu cause he is into martial arts. Anyways my apologies.English isn #8217;t my first language. I got some frozen ones.Real expensive.I wish I lived somewhere I could get them fresh. I live in India Never ever give up! Headache due to intacranial hypertension.Felt like smashing my head with a hammer. Uhh my heart My crush lives in another country and this one day he just shows up at the gym and texts me hey I am back home.Come to the gym(that #8217;s were we actually met for the first time before he moved to another country).I couldn #8217;t believe it was happening.I had no idea he was coming home.He had told me he won #8217;t be coming home till next year so it was a total surprise. Enchanted and you belong with me-Taylor swift Need a guy like this Feels like I am the second choice in every friendship  I just need someone who #8217;s understanding and won #8217;t treat me as an option.I love talking and listening to people and sharing my story.But right now I feel like shit cause everyone would choose literally anyone over me.If anyone wants to talk hit me up. Maybe you should tell him.I am fatter than my crush too.But see the thing is if it #8217;s something real and there really is a connection it won #8217;t matter.My crush has abs and I am sure he never judged me for being fat.Infact he always supported me.My story isn #8217;t the ideal fairy tale where everything worked out but letting out your feelings does help.Atleast you #8217;ll know for sure if you need to move on. I feel lighter after confessing.We are still friends but every situation is different.If it messes up your head too much you should just tell him.He might like you back and in case he doesn #8217;t atleast you won #8217;t keep beating yourself up about it. The duration.Some people think since they have been with someone toxic for so long they should continue the relationship.They ignore all the red flags and continue it solely because it #8217;s been so long that they have been together. Should I ask him out?  So there is this guy and we connect.Last night I told him the kind of guy I want and he told me that #8217;s exactly what he looks in a girl.Thats basically me.I don #8217;t wanna ask him out and make it awkward cause we are in the same college and it can get really weird.He #8217;s shy and awkward too and probably why he won #8217;t ask either. The last time I took a leap it didn #8217;t work out and I am scared tbh.Should I ask him or keep waiting for him to ask me out? Is it worth waiting for someone who might be too shy and awkward to ask you out when it isn #8217;t even clear if he #8217;s just shy or if he #8217;s not into you?  So I have this friend.He #8217;s my senior and we usually just text.But if he runs into me in person he gets all awkward won #8217;t even say hi and pretend he didn #8217;t see him.we hit it off while chatting.We had a joke that we #8217;ll find someone for each other and I told him the kind of guy I want which is kinda like him.He told me he wants the same things in a girl which is basically me.He #8217;s told me before he #8217;s shy and awkward but I am not sure if he likes me or not.The things he said he looks for Ina girl,I fit the criteria but I am not sure if I should make the first move and ask him out.What if he doesn #8217;t like me?It would be very awkward and weird and I don #8217;t wanna embarrass myself. I guess.I have wasted years on someone,made the move but it didn #8217;t happen.I guess now I am just scared. I guess.Its just weird asking him out.What if he says no and then college will be so weird and everybody would be making fun of me.Sounds stupid I know but I am just confused as to how I should proceed. Your situation is so similar to mine except it was in the gym.I searched for my guy for so long and eventually found him.I am not exactly sure how you should go about it but I hope you find him.Umm maybe check the followers of the guy who put his pic.If he #8217;s on Instagram he would be following him.Unless you really really like that coffee place and don #8217;t wanna risk ever going back there you should just ask someone there.Its easier and atleast you #8217;ll know.The guy did seem into you. Just go there and see who #8217;s most friendly and ask them if they know who he is.Go from there. The guy I like has this hot model friend.I check her profile religiously.Maybe he doesn #8217;t even like her but I feel so insecure.Always thinking maybe I should be skinny model like her.I have been trying to get rid of this unhealthy obsession.The only insecurity I have is I think he would choose her over me even though we get along really well. Is it weird the first thing that popped into my head was my crush lol Perhaps it #8217;s a good thing he doesn #8217;t live near me.Might have given the lickpocalyse a try otherwise. This is so adorable #128525; #128525; #128525; Thissssss Fuck kickboxing Marry squats and dead lifts Kill running Ex love of my life said it wasn #8217;t talking it was just replying back after two days or a week after we had been chatting everyday for over a year and a half and I wasn #8217;t the only one initiating conversations. Spot reduction.You can #8217;t just lose fat from your tummy by doing more crunches or thin out your arms by training them.You #8217;ll lose it eventually by working out and maintaining a calorie deficit. Put all sorts of stupid gym stories on Instagram and learnt kickboxing which wasn #8217;t too bad tbh Your crush always likes you back.The cool jerk guy not only falls for the sweet innocent girl but also changes himself for the better just for her. It sucks  It sucks when you are there for everyone during their time of need but no one is there for you when you need them. It sucks when you consider a friend so important that you would do anything for them but when it comes to their shitty ass cheating boyfriend you don #8217;t even exist anymore. It sucks when you clean her tears but when you are crying she is not even near you. Life sucks. You should totally change yourself and give up something that makes you special only to impress a total stranger who you thought was the love of your life. I am not saying she doesn #8217;t have any problems.Definitely more than me.But I am always there for her.Always.But she saw me crying and not being in a good place and left.And I am not gonna bring this up cause she #8217;s just gonna say her problems are bigger cause she #8217;s in a relationship and since I am single I won #8217;t get them. 22 F looking for a good friend  This is not my first post here but everytime I hit off with someone it lasts for a few days and then it #8217;s over.Right now I am feeling really low and missing someone I shouldn #8217;t be missing.I can #8217;t text him and I shouldn #8217;t.Need a friend who can help me through this phase.Thanks in advance to anyone who responds :) Hey what #8217;s up? He #8217;s in dental college and I am in medical college.Same city still haven #8217;t seen him in years. Again and again and again  It happened again.Someone chose another human being and forgot all about me.Maybe I am just good for texting.Maybe I am only good enough to be a support system when you need me.Maybe I am only good enough to talk to for hours on end but not actually ask out on a date. No but this time I was careful.I didn #8217;t run after you.I took my time to fall.You kept texting me.Hell I can still see your notifications popping up as I am typing this but you want someone else.But now I have fallen or I think I have and just like all the other times there is someone else. I miss you  I miss you.Wish I could say that to you rather than typing it here.You know I did kicks yesterday.You always helped me with kickboxing.I finally did some kicks yesterday.I so wish I could show you what I did.Maybe you could tell me how awesome or terribly wrong I was. You know what,I am scared.You became such an important part of my life and now we don #8217;t even text and I am scared I #8217;ll forget you.Its been weeks since we last texted each other and those moments when I don #8217;t think about you.Sorry accidentally don #8217;t think about you cause I am busy or talking to someone I get so scared.I wanna move on but I am so scared of forgetting you.I know you probably have forgotten all about me.I don #8217;t even wish I could do the same.I still want you even if it #8217;s just in the memories. I will always love you even if I forget you. XOXO kiddo(I always hated when you called me that) Guys who text a lot,are they shy to meet you in person or just disinterested?  I have a history of talking to guys and hitting it off.We end up texting for hours on end but when we run into each other in a social setting they ignore my existence.I am not particularly unattractive.But I don #8217;t get this.Why not talk in person if you text so much.Especially if you have said you want a girlfriend and I clearly showed an interest in you.Why completely ignore my existence in person? We either go to the same gym or same college.Yeah they know what I look like.Like one was my dreamy gym crush and we actually ended up texting for over a year and half.The other was my college senior who initiated conversations too.We text about general stuff.The senior usually complains about being single blah blah and I am thinking to myself I am a girl.Ask me out.We clearly hit it off well and he described the kind of girl he wants to date and I fit the criteria. He did Muay Thai too.Kept calling me kiddo cause I am younger.We live on the opposite sides of the world so I would send him videos and he would correct my form.Wake me up to watch ufc matches.I wish he could see I finally did a kick. Maybe.Just felt a connection.Its not like I don #8217;t have guy friends.I am sorry I am being a cribby kid but I am kinda falling for him and I am very very scared to be hurt again.Maybe I am not his type afterall.But even as friends he can say hi to me if we run into each other if we spent hours texting. He was a runner too.I run away from running #128514; Sure I will tag you :) I know he #8217;s a little shy and moreover we are in the same college.I am not too sure but apparently he asked out someone in the past and got rejected.Maybe he #8217;s just too scared.People talk and maybe he just wants to avoid public humiliation.Not that I would tell anyone or even say no in the first place.But he can still say hi.Saying hi in person doesn #8217;t mean we are dating or am I not cool enough to say hi to. The year and a half case was a total bullshit phase of my life.Thats why I am scared for the other guy.Is he shy or just wants to be friend.He got shit drunk and flirted with some chick the other day but he won #8217;t even say hi to me in person. Perhaps I could score a date in the virtual world then :(.Reality isn #8217;t working out too well for me you see. It sucks though.When you text for hours but god forbid we run into each other during a social setting like a college party or work he doesn #8217;t have to ignore me like I don #8217;t exist especially if we were up talking till 1 am the previous night.I am not a social outcast if that #8217;s what you are wondering. I made the move last time only to get hurt but I understand that was more of an impossible situation.This guy initiated conversations.Now I am falling and he #8217;s talking about other girls or the fact he wants to focus on his career and stuff like that.Plus he #8217;s in my college and I don #8217;t want to be laughing stock.So I am very scared.What if I am not his type.His friends all have very showy girlfriends. Maybe.He told me he got shit drunk and was flirting with some girl from another college but he doesn #8217;t want anything serious so won #8217;t pursue that.I saw him leave with arms around her that night.I was at that party too.I ignored his texts the next morning but then he texted me again and we again ended up texting for hours.He isn #8217;t too responsive these days and I don #8217;t feel like texting me. I don #8217;t know anymore.I know he isn #8217;t a fuckboy really but I don #8217;t know if he is shy or what.Maybe I just thought it could be something real with this guy after all my stupid virtual crushes and I just love talking to him.I just wanted to get to know his better to see if it could have been something more. DAE feel they do more for their friends but when it #8217;s your turn your friends are never there for you? Yeah I guess.It would be easier though if he would atleast spare me a look but thanks for your help ;) Hahaha thanks for the offer.I am just confused if I should risk confessing.I am pretty sure he #8217;s gonna say no only and does he even deserve a confession if he can #8217;t even say hi to me in person.If I confront him about it he #8217;ll be like I didn #8217;t see you,I was too drunk blah blah. Yeah we did end up talking about all this and my feelings after I put this post. He told me I am sweet girl and he can #8217;t do me wrong and he doesn #8217;t want anything serious.Spent an hour trying to console me.I am doing fine but ofcourse it hurts a little. This almost brought tears to my eyes.Thats how badly I wanted to read that. You are in for an adventure.Its gonna be amazing but shit expensive.If you do go to Switzerland make sure you have Interlaken on your list.Eiffel tower at night is magnificent. Yeah.But I think I am gonna take some time off and focus on myself.Of Course after I am done eating a tub of ice cream and everything sweet in my sight.But I am really tired of all that has happened over the past few months.I feel mentally exhausted.Like I wanna run away but I don #8217;t have any place to run to. Gym is the place of my first heartbreak lol.Quite the reverse situation here but yeah I love working out and I am not gonna give that up.Just gonna spoil myself today,workout and get back to work tomorrow .Thanks for all your help. Holy shit.It feels like I am the one who wrote this.Seriously what do you do in such a situation.I lost all this weight and I am still single.Only guys I don #8217;t want pursue me.I am told I am pretty but still single till date. I did start getting more attention from guys but no one worth pursuing.I am literally in the same situation as the user who wrote this post. My story was exactly the same.Well till she said yes and agreed to be your gf.My guy said you can have a strand of my hair and clone me and keep me forever. My story was exactly like you l.confessed to move on and get it over with.Really happy with the outcome of your confession :) Hey I am 22 from India.I get that feeling.I have been through the same thing.Text me of you ever need to talk. Heyyyyyyyy Good good what about you? Same here I hope the same for you :) Watching the office is the tv equivalent of having abs.Extremely attractive. That is so cute though #128525; #128525; #128525; I would so happily accept a flower from this little adorable creature #10084; #65039; Should I text him or not?  So basically I had a crush on this guy,he knew but we were still good friends.Recently he said he needs time off of social media and doesn #8217;t want to or can #8217;t talk.Basically we didn #8217;t end on great terms.After like a month of no contact he comments on my recent Instagram post and replied to one of my stories.My friends think he wants to talk but I shouldn #8217;t because he said pretty hurtful things the last time we talked and I was finally moving on.But I can #8217;t stop wondering whether I should send hey,have a little chat.I miss him Ofcourse.I am scared what if he ignores me or is rude again. It #8217;s been way over a month since we talked.So I shouldn #8217;t send a hey? I am exactly like you.At this point I have started considering do I only like guys who won #8217;t like me back? Any suggestions for what I can prep for breakfast?  I am new to meal prepping and I live in a hostel.I can cook the meal at home but ultimately I only have access to a refrigerator and an induction for storing and heating purposes.Any suggestions for breakfast as I am always late and need to grab something fast. I really like the overnight oats idea.Might even add some protein powder to it.Thanks :) I might make a batch of muffins.Pretty easy and I can have them along with some coffee.If you have any good recipe for banana oat muffin or any other healthy alternative please let me know :) Thanks :) That #8217;s some really good options.Thanks :) Thanks :) First time meal prepping.Grilled chicken,Cauliflower rice and roasted broccoli. This makes me so hungryyyy *they call you that. I am so sleep deprived that I was upvoting the upvote button in the picture and then wondering why is my screen not working. Yep.The sole basis of our friendship is mutual insult.Its almost like a little competition of who can roast better lol. Waking up We are served shit here. Please just don #8217;t  Now you are texting me.After a month of no contact now.You said some pretty hurtful things last time we talked.So unless it #8217;s an apology please don #8217;t text me. Hope you get well soon.There is always always something worth living for and someone does value you.Just look around and if you can #8217;t find one look in the mirror.That person is very valued and loved.Hope you have a great day :) Symmetry in nature Legs for me too.I used to hate my legs cause they were fat.Loathed them.Ever since I started working I have fallen love with them.Even though I don #8217;t have thin pretty legs but I feel so strong and I absolutely love them. TIFU by dropping my airpods in the water while talking to a cute guy at the gym  So there is this really cute guy at the gym and we often exchange glances but I am too shy stupid piece of shit to go upto him and initiate a conversation.Its been a few days and today I thought if he looks this way I #8217;ll pass a smile or something.So it happens that we are getting water at the same time(purely coincidental lol) and I had my boxing gloves in one hand and my phone in the other.I strategically place my gloves on my arm to get some water when the guy asks me do you box? So this is him initiating a conversation and I am beyond excited.I take out my AirPod to talk to him and with so many things in my hands and me being an utterly stupid awkward being I drop my AirPod in the water while talking to the guy.Then I proceed to make an even bigger fool out of myself by cursing and panicking over the loss of my beloved babies.I don #8217;t think he #8217;ll make a move again after seeing the mess I am. TL;DR Cute guy approached me at the gym.Got nervous and dropped my airpods in a glass of water making a fool out of myself. I #8217;ll smile and say hello the next time I see him.Hopefully he won #8217;t run away lol. Hope so.I was doing for cute kickass girl in the gym.Ended up with that lol.Hopefully he found my messy self adorable and won #8217;t run away the next time I run into him. *throws dumbbell on the foot to look cute lol Thanks for making me feel better though :) That #8217;s gonna be my go to breakfast now.Looks amazing. Goodboi I want a goodboi This is so true.I would definitely want a guy to make an attempt to know me as a person before anything else. It takes a lot of hard work to get into med school.Dude career and life first.There are gonna be plenty of people.I am already in med school and I legit spoiled my 3rd year crying over someone who wasn #8217;t nearly worth it.Thats the biggest regret I have.People come and go.Focus on yourself and your goals. My best friend started dating my other friends boyfriend #8217;s best friend  The title is self explanatory as confusing as it maybe.Ever since she started dating him she #8217;s naturally closer to the other friend as they are dating two best friends and I feel so left.Not only do I have no one in my life now I don #8217;t even have a friend.I drive around alone all day trying to cheer myself up but nothing works.They are always talking about their bfs and other common stuff.What am I supposed to do? Stare at their faces when they are texting their boyfriends.They can atleast have the decency to put the phone down when they are with other people.But if I say anything I am the bad one. My best friend #8217;s relationship is new.She recently got out of a very toxic relationship and I always supported her through that and she still ignored me then.I understood then cause she always blamed the guy and how he doesn #8217;t want her to spend much time with her friends.I don #8217;t wanna sound some attention seeking friend but I just hoped things would be a little different now after everything I supported her through and how the guy ultimately cheated and left her.I am extremely happy she found this new guy.He #8217;s really nice but I just wish she would just get off her phone once in a while and look at other people around her. Not at all good.Sad and lonely and nobody wants me. Lately I can #8217;t stop eating.I don #8217;t know what #8217;s gotten into me but I just can #8217;t.This might sound like a desperate call for help but it is what it is.I am literally eating again as I am typing this and I had a proper lunch and breakfast.I can #8217;t seem to stop.Someone please help me. I can think of a couple of things bothering me but there #8217;s not much I can do about it and it #8217;s seriously affecting my studies.I feel so hungry all the damn time. Thank you so much :) I #8217;ll try meal planning and keeping myself hydrated and most importantly busy.If I am working I won #8217;t be hungry and sad all the time.Thanks :) In the rom com novel version they fall in love and live happily ever after I might make waffles for him :) I feel like I can never be happy or love myself  This sounds like a desperate call for help.Maybe it is.I feel like I am stuck in a rut and I #8217;ll never be happy.I lost a ton of weight and that felt good for a while but then it didn #8217;t.Nothing makes me happy anymore.I know I should love myself before expecting anyone else to love me but why is it so damn hard?All my friends are in relationships and I have been single all my life.My friends say I am pretty or cute and I am interesting but I somehow refuse to believe that.I am constantly belittling myself thinking what is it that they have and I don #8217;t.Why doesn #8217;t anyone like me?Am I that bad?Don #8217;t I deserve to be happy.I am not exactly sure what I am doing here but if anyone of you can put a smile on my face even for a millisecond I will be eternally grateful to you. I am so sorry you had to go through that.I hope things are better for you now. I did sprints at 18km/hr today.Thats my personal best and I am not the fittest person.I am just so happy #128512; Quit To my parents  I came home cause I am sad and lonely there.I can #8217;t talk to you about everything but you know I am not doing good.You talk to me assure me that you support me and want me to think positive.But the very next day you again expect me to be perfect.I can #8217;t be normal in 2 days when all I can think about is how everybody #8217;s life would be better if I wasn #8217;t in it.I don #8217;t want to be like this.I don #8217;t want to cry all the time.All I want is someone to hold me and say that they are here and I matter.I feel like a burden on everyone and I am so so tired.Please please understand I am not doing any of this to hurt you or cause you trouble.I don #8217;t need anything from you just some love and affection. I really thought it was a legitimate hobby 2meirl4meirl It #8217;s my favourite pastime too I actually thought that was popcorn when I first looked at it while scrolling. He basically watched me workout and then texts me it makes him happy to watch me workout He #8217;s written Hindi in English if that makes any sense.People in India do that. That #8217;s tough to type.This is way easier. The ice in my iced coffee melted before I could drink it. So needed to read that.Bye Reddit I am off studying. This is soooo me.I am fucked(laughs nervously) Medicine Iced coffee was supposed to make me more alert so that I study medicine.But by the time I sat down on my table it was too late. Would I still be your daughter if I am not perfect? Mine told me he #8217;ll send a piece of his hair and I can clone him if I want in my life. I am sorry I don #8217;t get that Now I get what he m- It #8217;s she gets i- Why do I relate with her so much? More live no more will to function but let #8217;s go with the arthritis thing.Physical pain definitely gets more attention than mental stuff. Are there any podcasts I can listen to while studying?  I am sorry if this is a stupid question.I am new to podcasts and want to incorporate more of them in my life. Woah woah you are in for a surprise That #8217;s what she s- Yeah I agree.I usually listen to some music while studying.Helps me concentrate better.I was wondering if there was a podcast out there with something similar. Thanks for your help:) I #8217;ll give this a try.Thanks :) I #8217;ll listen to it.Thanks :) This sounds interesting I prefer calm music too.Rarely something with words.I figured maybe there is a podcast out there which would help me concentrate better. Me too.If you have any suggestions let me know :) I #8217;ll definitely check it out thanks:) The hottest criminal Mesmerising ceramics Mesmerising ceramics The way these ceramics are made Buy expensive razors so that I can cut myself in style.Rest on quality shit expensive booze. That #8217;s Amy Santiago All people say is you gotta do it yourself  I know they are right.Nobody can help me.I have to help myself.But I wish somebody would say you have to do it yourself but I am here to help you get there.Somebody who knows when I say I am fine I am going to go to my room and cut myself.Just somebody who gets me.It takes a lot of courage for me to even speak when I start to spiral,to call someone for help.Even if my best friend is sitting in front of me I can #8217;t speak a word to her,tell her what #8217;s going through my mind.I don #8217;t want to tell anyone.All I want right now is alcohol and some razors or maybe someone to save me cause as much as people say I gotta do it myself I have given up.I can #8217;t do it.Please just someone help me. Thanks :) What if the someone is from your country but moved to another country? Which country is he representing then lol Same here.Haven #8217;t been truly happy in so long. Worth all the trouble if I just get to see him once That #8217;s amazing.I am two days clean.Keep going man! It #8217;s 1 g per kg Atleast that #8217;s what they teach us Me too.I used to love working out.No matter what happened gym was my happy place.Didn #8217;t miss a single day.And now nothing.I literally have to pick myself to go there and once I am there I just sit around and come back. I used to love Neurology.So passionate about it.Started a research project in my second year of college.Now I am not even motivated enough to finish or even read about the subject I loved so much.Nothing makes me happy anymore. He #8217;ll tell his life stories.Like how hard he had it and how easy it #8217;s for us.How he had to walk miles to school. He takes care of a lot of things without letting either of me and my brother know.Like if I go home in my car when I come back to college the fuel tank is always full.Its probably a very small thing but he does stuff like this not as a gesture but just something he thinks dads are supposed to do. He stands for half an hour in line to get chicken when I have to come home cause he knows I love it.He always goes out of his way to make us comfortable in every possible way. I love him very much Heartbreak You know what  It took every fibre of my being to text you.We haven #8217;t talked in months.I was doing good at pretending you don #8217;t exist in my life anymore.Thats what you wanted right.Ofcourse you made a few appearances when you wanted but no this time I wanted to keep my self respect.But today,I couldn #8217;t do it.The cutting didn #8217;t help,getting shit drunk didn #8217;t help,losing all my friends certainly didn #8217;t help and jumping from the fifth floor seemed like the only option when I decided maybe I should keep my self respect aside for just one night and text you.Literally beg you to talk to me cause I could really use someone to talk to.But you did what you do best.Left me on read.Thanks dude.Right now jumping off the fifth floor seemed like a much better option. Every damn day I was cutting myself under the table today. The way the candle is lit Every damn day [2meirl4meirl] Every damn day Nah I am sure it #8217;s his number Today was #8220;almost #8221; a good day  I did a great boxing workout.I wore tank top for the first time in my life.I have always been really conscious about my fat arms.Never wore them.But today I did.Felt confident af.But then I was reminded of how lonely I am.How nobody would even know if I vanish.How my best friend thinks all I want is a guy.Basically how my life sucks.So now I have vodka in one hand and I am typing with the other how I #8220;almost #8221; had a good day. The toy is so cool I watched the movie last night.There was applause hooting and everything.The movie portrays Kabir Singh as MCP.Sure he was a jerk and being a medical student myself I could see how many things are wrong there.I personally hated the girl #8217;s character.Kabir stood for her at every aspect and she let him.I presented a paper,I was critiqued but that taught me stuff.Him standing on the stage while she delivers a speech was fucking ridiculous .The girl couldn #8217;t do anything by herself.Come on.I could go on about the flaws honestly. But Maybe Kabir Singh had an obsession.Maybe he actually did love her very much even though his way of showing love is looked down upon.But what is shown in the movie actually happens.People feel so fucking vulnerable these days,scared of a broken heart and doing every possible thing to fix themselves and trust me it #8217;s not easy especially when you have the stress of mbbs on you.I would have loved to see him get out of it in a better way.Hell it might have helped me get out of my spiral.Hated the end. WHILE PEOPLE ARE GOING ON ABOUT HOW KABIR SINGH PORTRAYS LOVE AND SOCIETY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO SEE HOW IT ALSO SHOWS HOW BAD YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CAN GET AND HOW ITS A CRY FOR HELP. Edit:- PS I hated what he said about fat girls being teddy bear and nice and caring.I have been fucking rejected for being nice and caring.Guess what I am fit now still rejected still drinking myself to sleep so stop thinking fat girls are some cute pandas or something.We can be bad ass too. Feeling wanted I wish I didn #8217;t hate myself and wasn #8217;t so sad and lonely all the time. It #8217;s worse when you were there for everyone in every possible way but now when you are the one going through stuff they pretend they can #8217;t even see you are going through stuff Wouldn #8217;t I still be lonely? Doesn #8217;t feel like it but thanks. Aren #8217;t I already? I don #8217;t ask for help much but I could literally be breaking down in front of them and they won #8217;t even bother. Oh my god the exact same thing has happened to me. Nobody dates teddy bears.They are just supposed to be nice right Will I ever get over __________ I have been in this situation twice and honestly I got my heart broken.I really really really hope this works out for the best but don #8217;t get your hopes too high.It hurts bad in the end. I have been in this situation.The first one lasted for over a year and half.Texting daily.Even after confession which somehow kept the hope alive(the confession was after a year of texting daily). The second case again.I am still talking to the guy daily but man it hurts when he talks about some other girl or he #8217;s too shy to talk in person or whatever. Just be careful.I don #8217;t want you to get your heart broken. One really good advice someone gave me was #8220;unless he says clearly I like you assume he doesn #8217;t #8221; And in case you really do and feel like telling him would take a load off of you go ahead and do it.Its better to be over with it now than to keep suppressing your feelings for so long.I know both these things sound contradictory but I hope you find happiness whatever the outcome maybe. I am from india too man.Thought you are from Hyderabad when you wrote ex Muslim state.I am a punjabi.Few years elder to you.Doing mbbs and regretting it lol. Yeah I read that in one of your comments.Sounds really weird but all I can think about is kebabs and biryaani lol. How are doing btw? Story of my life I am just so tired of pretending to be happy  People say if you pretend to be happy eventually you will be.When I was in a better mental space I gave so many fucks about people.Taking care of them.Basically being there when they needed me and here I am stuck and nobody is there to help me.I was always there for the person I called my best friend.From covering for her pregnancy and taking care of her during her abortion,supporting her through her abusive relationship and always making her my priority.She always has some guy as her priority and honestly I am sick of it.We cleared the air last week.I told her I have hit so low and you aren #8217;t even there.I am cutting myself,drinking to sleep,can #8217;t focus,crying all day.Its so so hard for me to ask for help but I still somehow gathered the courage and got shot down every damn time.I will deal with this alone.I will drink.I will cut myself.None of these people need to give a fuck about me.But atleast don #8217;t even pretend you do. Asking me not to drink my morning coffee is ridiculous.Its my life.I will drink the god damn coffee.You can #8217;t be here when I needed you.Now telling me not to drink coffee cause you care about me and how it #8217;s not good for my health is bullshit.I don #8217;t need you beating me up for having a cup of coffee.(Sorry this last part doesn #8217;t make any sense.My so called best friend beats me up for having coffee daily with breakfast and honestly I got tired of it and said fine I #8217;ll throw it in the trash and she walked off pissed at me).Motherfucker couldn #8217;t be here when I was crying and cutting myself literally standing in front of her crying.Why the hell she cares what I drink. Again sorry for this rant.Thanks to anyone who took out the time to read it. Same in India Paid the last instalment of my med school tuition fees :)  I have been feeling so unmotivated and hating myself and life in general.Been going through a dark phase of my life where I have been isolating myself and cutting and thinking things will never get better.Feeling empty.But walking out of the accounts office yesterday,it felt like how close I am to finishing this.I #8217;ll be a doctor by the end of this year.That is something to look forward to.Something that I used to be so passionate about.I don #8217;t how long this feeling of euphoria and motivation is gonna last but I sure as hell see myself as being something more than who I am today. It #8217;s hard to get professional help.Being surrounded by doctors all day I feel like they are just gonna say it #8217;s the stress of the final year and I can #8217;t really talk about what #8217;s bothering me cause of the fear of judgement.But I am trying to take baby steps to get better. Yep.Then I start one year internship and prepping for my post grad Yeah they would but then again they are also my professors and talking to them would be hard.Its hard for me to talk to anyone really cause I know they are just gonna judge me.We get free consultation inside the hospital where I study and I don #8217;t afford to go to any counsellor outside and my parents are not big on the whole mental health thing.According to them I just need to think positively. This.I keep wondering couldn #8217;t it have happened at a different time.This is the most important year of med school and I can #8217;t even a look at a book right now.Its not like I don #8217;t try but it #8217;s really hard to focus when you are breaking down and barely managing to keep sane.The fact that nobody even checks up on me,the constant feeling of loneliness seems to suck the life out of me. I am in 4th year now.Working out used to be my thing.I hit the gym even close to finals.But now it takes so much energy to even get off the bed.I have been hitting the gym pretty hard this week to keep myself sane but then I get so tired I can #8217;t study.I haven #8217;t experienced the post workout high in ages.I feel empty driving to the gym.Feel empty coming back.Just generally tired of feeling like this all the time. No I am in India.Yeah I have been trying kickboxing to calm me down.But it does get me very tired.I am also looking into tennis.Will be taking a few lessons this month. Me too.Needed to hear that. I went to the gym today and the lib.Read a small topic.Its nothing as compared to what I need to study but it #8217;s a start. He called me a nurse even though I am studying to be a doctor only cause I am a female. His total disrespect for everyone was such a turn off.The idgaf was only sexy for some time. Despite the awkward pose the jogger does look cute lol. He #8217;s gonna be in a shit ton of memes though. Oh my god I have done that more times than I can remember. I have an exam tomorrow.I should probably ___________ I woke up from a nap to read this lol Does anybody feel totally drained and not having any energy at all?  I slept well last night,barely did anything today.But it feels like I have no energy at all.Like I can #8217;t even stand.Hell I feel like I don #8217;t even have the energy to type this.I am so tired of feeling so empty all the time.Isn #8217;t ending it all better than feeling like this?I mean who would even care.I am just so tired and I haven #8217;t done a thing. I miss you  I shouldn #8217;t really.I am supposed to hate you right.But man I miss you.Come back just once.Pleaseeeeeee. Yeap.All the damn time.Its like I wanna hurt myself :( He won #8217;t :( I wish I were Sarah Today was supposed to be good.I finally felt like studying after so many months.I wanted to do something good.Get up.Then shit happened and now I have already cut myself and I don #8217;t want to stop.I just wanna keep going back to the washroom and make more cuts.I give up. Anybody has trouble asking for help?  I take one step forward and two steps back.Just feels like I can #8217;t do it anymore and if I ask for help from someone they are just gonna get annoyed.How long will I bother someone?I so tired of feeling like this.Some days start good.But by the end I am cutting myself and putting up a post here.I just wanna rush to the washroom and cut myself again.God what am I supposed to do :( Woah I wasn #8217;t even expecting a reply.I am sitting in a room without anything I can cut myself with.I don #8217;t have alcohol to numb this or make me feel something.I don #8217;t know what this is.I can #8217;t sleep.I can #8217;t study.I am just sitting here.I don #8217;t know what to do.Feels like everything is just spinning around me and I am stuck in the centre of it all. 22 Female Coffee Waffles Depends on what genre you like Why could go wrong If If someone improvise simple barbell curls Hey man.Whats up? 21st is a biggg number.Happy happy birthday!!! Don #8217;t forget to pamper yourself today.Its your day. I did that today.Even though I have an exam tomorrow.Just didn #8217;t have the energy to do anything. Now that #8217;s a genre I had forgotten about lol. Honestly I don #8217;t watch many movies but I love watching the office.It always makes me feel better.Have you watched it? I have heard if it yes but I haven #8217;t watched it.My country just released their version of the office.I am not sure if I like it or find it utterly annoying.They have copied all the characters but no one can replace Steve Carell. India Yeah.Its alright.Visit in winters though.Kinda depends where you are going.Where are you from if I may ask? Yeah same username as Reddit What #8217;s your username? Yeah I like to workout and bake but I haven #8217;t done either in quite some time.I somehow manage to show up to gym but I don #8217;t have the energy to workout anymore. Edit:-Just wanna confirm your username cause I got a couple of requests last night And I can #8217;t even get a duck to kiss me My first journal.Been battling depression.Thought this might help :) Hey.Maybe I can help :) That #8217;s heartbreak in a video Same here.I feel exactly like you do.Exactly the same situation.It sucks and it #8217;s so hard to put yourself out there again. Same I had a feeling it was a little photoshopped but I was very impressed by the fact they didn #8217;t hide the stretch marks.People assume stretch marks are something unreal and should be removed. I got my eyebrows done !  It #8217;s probably pretty insignificant but I have been putting it off for months thinking what difference would that make?Who look at my ugly face.Had totally given up on all forms of self care.Feeling accomplished in a weird way. Thank you! Feels nice to be appreciated Thank you so much:) I used to take care of myself so much.Pamper myself.Think I am a princess or something lol.This small thing today made me feel like I can do anything.I hit the gym later and did a good workout after so long. I read the title in Doug Judy #8217;s voice This is actually pretty smart I was recommended Reddit by someone.I hadn #8217;t even heard of it before but it #8217;s life changing.People here are so supportive and I made some good friends.People really help you through tough times.Makes me wonder how people who have no idea who you are and live across the world and can be so much nicer than those sitting right next to you. I liked his comment from 179 weeks ago  I was stalking him and saw some girl flirting with him in the comments and ended up liking his comment on his picture.Fuckkkkkk. I am trying to get over him cause we don #8217;t have a chance but this is gonna send such a wrong weirdly creepy message to him. Man I need a dog.I am in a really dangerous situation. I kinda have history with the guy and we are supposed to be in a fight or a Cold War really.I was taking a stand lol.Thats down the toilet now #128514; Hahaha this cracked me up Maybe it #8217;s really late at night or whatever but even this made me laugh.Atleast a decent chuckle. I have been in a similar situation so many times.It sucks man :( From crush to crash :( It #8217;s like I set myself up for hurt and disappointments sometimes :( On the rare occasions I use Facebook I keep looking for the downvote button and miss it so much.People post absolute shit sometimes. Yep.Happens all the time.They #8217;ll be like how do you know that? I often joke I am stalking you to creep them out further before reminding them that they told me so in the first place. You #8217;re so cute :) Smile bigger.I bet you look cuter when you smile :) I used to smile but recently I have lost my smile.But hey keep going.Don #8217;t be deadguy no more lol These kind of people are the worse.Its tough as it is for people who start a gym cause they are so self conscious.I remember being one of them,so conscious about my weight and the way I look and my physical incapabilities.Though I have met plenty of bullies who judged me for being fat I am just happy I met a couple of people who encouraged me and made me believe I can do it when I first started. The way these water droplets fall on the ground Feeling really down.Today wasn #8217;t a good day.So tired of being lonely and depressed all the time :(  I guess I will always be like that.I have accepted nobody is gonna magically appear to make it all better but god I wish there was someone out there for me,just someone who gave a damn about me. Edit:-Oh my god my first gold.Thank you so so much :) Edit 2:-Just noticed you literally turned the frown upside down! Thank you so much for replying.It means a lot.I am trying to take little steps at a time.I wish I could keep a pet.It would have helped so much the loneliness.I considered getting professional help but it #8217;s just not an option for me right now. Thank you so much.Its usually really hard for me to reveal to others what I am going through and what #8217;s triggering my depression. Thank you so much.Most days I don #8217;t even have the energy to even get up.I wasn #8217;t like this.I don #8217;t even know what happened all of a sudden.I was someone who could go to gym twice,manage college,cook,study etc.Now I just lie here.I hope to start getting out there.Thinking of joining a tennis class during vacations. It #8217;s hard to think I deserve anything.Everytime I put myself out there I was rejected.My friends get offers without making any efforts and here I am trying and getting rejected.But I am working on not feeling like this.Thank you so much :) I considered therapy but that #8217;s just not an option for me right now.Thanks for the suggestion though :) That explains a lot.I thought I was being ignored and deleted my post soon after posting.Thank you :) If I am that important why hasn #8217;t a single person returned my call or texted me.I know it #8217;s wrong of me to expect others are gonna check up on me but didn #8217;t I do that when they were down.One call or even a text asking how I was doing.I got so tired of hopelessly looking at my phone I eventually put it on airplane mode last night with zero expectations.I didn #8217;t even expect this post to get a response.I sometimes use Reddit as my diary.Writing on here makes me feel better and I really really appreciate you responding. I wish I was her  She #8217;s prettier right or maybe thinner.You are not embarrassed to talk to her in front of anyone.Is it that? Are you embarrassed to admit you are my friend in front of others.Either case I wish I was her.Maybe you would have noticed me then. The other day I was struggling to take a picture of my breakfast so my dad picked up the plate so that I could take a nice picture.Made my day:) I love both of your dresses She exists.Its not like it #8217;s the first time somebody has done that to me.Chat for hours and then pretend they don #8217;t even know me in person.If they didn #8217;t like my personality they won #8217;t talk to me in the first place right.I don #8217;t know.It just makes me feel really worthless and constantly comparing myself to girls they do talk to in person. Yeah.I love him for these little gestures:) Thanks :) I posted this one when it was first released .Really inspiring. I did eat after the picture :) What made me smile was the fact that my dad didn #8217;t get all annoyed cause I wanted to take a picture.Instead he helped me and then we had breakfast. Thank you so much.This means a lot :) I thought I made a good effort with my breakfast and wanted to click a picture.Its not always about impressing someone This is so amazing! I #8217;ll convey your hey and the compliments. Thank you so much :) Haha thanks It #8217;s a big part of his personality.I don #8217;t think I have ever seen him without his beard. Haha I never noticed that Exactly. I do.It looks so unreal.I legit stared at for so long.I absolutely loved it.The best I have seen. Happy birthday #127874; #127881; May you get all that you wish for in life :) All the best.Speedy recovery :) Thank you :) We don #8217;t get avocados where I live too often.I wanted to document that one time we got avocados lol. Thank you :) Please god please take me away.I can #8217;t do this anymore But it broke our hearts :( I was looking for this one The balance of this guy! That is an awesome achievement #128079; #128079; #128079; Their precision and strength is amazing and the movement is so satisfying! Thank you so much :) Granola bars for a quick healthy snack between classes Thank you :) Yeah sure :) I made it by approximation since I have been making it for quite some time so you might wanna look up the exact measurements online. Mix in oats,nuts,dried berries,chocolates basically anything you want in a big bowl. Melt some butter in a pan.Once it #8217;s melted and kinda sizzling add in some brown sugar,mix it in.Let it cook a little and add in honey.Thats the caramel thing which binds it all together.Make sure you make enough.Add it to the dry ingredients,mix it well enough and scoop it out in a tin lined by foil(I buttered the foil too to make sure it doesn #8217;t stick).Press it in nicely and refrigerate for 3-4 hours.Cut it into bars and you are good to go. Again really sorry I couldn #8217;t give the exact measurements. Individually wrapped the bars in foil so that I can carry them easily :) That actually does look so much better.I was just making it up as I was typing . Even more reasons to hate it Feeling it as I am typing this :( Definitely trying this out tomorrow! That #8217;s amazing.I am pretty much in a similar situation.Every little bit helps.I went to the gym today! Just focus on yourself.I am a girl and I used to get so self conscious and not even go to weights room.Make sure you show up everyday.Thats how you gain the confidence to be there and you start getting comfortable.Remember everyone is there to better themselves .Sure there can be some judgemental assholes there and I was really lucky to have a couple of these big dudes who didn #8217;t put me down and motivated me but you are going to the gym for you.Not them.So don #8217;t give a shit what anyone thinks.Focus on your form(look up videos online if you don #8217;t have access to a good trainer) ,blast some music and have a kickass workout :) See if that is his approach to teaching you or motivating you but honestly if he isn #8217;t what you need change him.You are paying the gym and you deserve someone who pushes you and motivates you,not someone who lets you down.Find a trainer who is better suited to you. Cause I put a spell on it Magic is what makes them taste so good :) Oh my god now that you mention it I can totally see it!!! Amazing man #128175; People who are struggling with mental health issues what is the one thing you wish others knew or understood about whatever you are going through? I kinda share the same feeling.I feel like if I share what I am going through with anyone I #8217;ll be judged and punished. Feel ya Looks soooooo delicious ! I wanna SCREAM!!!!  I just wanna scream so loud.I am tired of this.Feeling depressed,then anxious,then full of rage.My teeth hurt from passively clenching them too much.The only thing that gave me peace was talking to #8220;him #8221;.The one person I am not supposed to talk to.If I tell my best friend(who #8217;s like my biggest support system right now),she #8217;ll leave me too.What am I supposed to do? I hate lying to her.I won #8217;t text him again but I want to tell her that I did but I am sure she #8217;ll leave me too.Who will I be left with then? Aaaaagggggghhhg But she told me not to text him and I have been asking her hypothetically.Like what if I did and she said then this would be over.Its really killing me not telling her. The office helps me battle depression  I am not even sure if this is the right sub for it but the only thing that #8217;s helping me through depression is the office.Watching it or even having it in the background when I sleep calms me down.I don #8217;t feel like cutting myself or drinking.The office is the best thing in my life right now.Just wanted to let people know how this show means to me and possibly everyone on this sub :) I know.The day I absolutely hit rock bottom,the only thing that ultimately calmed me down and made me fall asleep was the sound of Michael Scott.I am so grateful for this cause that day the only way out seemed to be killing myself. Hey man.Please be careful with your medication.I study epilepsy and most cases brought into emergency are cause of reduced blood levels of anti epileptic drugs.I wish you all the best #128077; #127995; You #8217;re a really pretty girl.Stay strong! Most epileptic patients respond well to medications.All the best.Hope you are seizure free soon #128077; #127995; This makes me so happy.I hope you start doing much much better :) I am your age and exactly in the same situation.Sometimes I get so sad I just switch off my phone.Its not like anyone is going to miss me. Also why so many questions.Its pretty clear what I did but I don #8217;t wanna give every second person details about it especially when I pretend to be absolutely normal in front of almost everyone(they don #8217;t know I am going through something).So I have a couple of bullshit stories I keep telling people how I got these scars.Just don #8217;t ask.\n",
            "Having breasts. When my friends and I were little, we were super hyped about having breasts. Wish I was flat, lol Dying while giving birth or being eaten by some animal alive. I am from Czech Republic and I honestly don't like Czech food in general. It's often meat (I'm vegetarian) and too salty or too sweet or very oily. The thing I hate the most isn't that typical but we do that a lot - fried cheese. I really just taste salt and oil. The way we do steaks is something I could talk about as well. But other Czechs love it. Nobody does that anymore since I said I will kill myself if they won't stop on my 7th birthday. I was a nice kid My PE teacher at my old school. She didn't really give a fucc about our health, I had some problems with my spine and shouldn't do gymnastics - sure I got some serious lessons to become a professional or what. She also didn't let girls have a rest if they were on they period. There was one girl with serious cramps, she was suffering just sitting in the class and she was almost fainting, but the nice teacher wouldn't let her take a seat, she would rather have a kid faint in the middle of a push-up. Her excuse was that she never felt any pain, so if anybody felt anything worse than a discomfort, she told them they are faking. She also didn't have problems insulting us for our appearance or physical abilities or people we were friends with and she compared us to our sporty classmates. Nobody really cared about her, because ,,she was just leading lazy kids to sports.\" She is the reason I changed school, I was her main target for my chubby body, short height and my introversion. I sometimes have something like anxiety attack to think about her and I have a hard time facing anybody I was in a class with. Sports never were my thing but after this experience, I feel like a piece of garbage. #10024;We'll carry on, we'll carry on And though you're dead and gone, believe me Your memory will carry on We'll carry on And in my heart, I can't contain it The anthem won't explain it #10024; I would rather have girls fantasizing about me. Having friends who respect me as I am, not trying to change me, my life or my opinions. I don't need people love me for who I am, all I really need and appreciate is a respect. ,,Well...\" Mental problems and illnesses. I don't think ill people should have the name of their illness tattooed on their forehead, I just think people often know only about stereotypes (like, schizophrenic necessarily has to be violent) and a lot of people won't go to a therapy because they think they would be judged. Basically - I wish people saw mental illnesses as they truly are and not as a taboo. I can't sleep with my door open. Not the hardest, but my native language - Czech - is pretty hard. We shape words a lot and not even an average adult person would get 6th grade test for 90% right. A lot of rules and a lot of words that don't follow the rules. We also have this bad boi - #344;, #345; Pink Reacting to LGBTQ+ memes Suddenly, I feel thankful for having door It's a letter with very weird pronunciation and even some native speakers have troubles saying it. Most countries don't use that. I recommend trying to learn the pronunciation, it's an experience #10084; #65039; #128522; Your misery and hate will kill us all So paint it black and take it back Most of the Youtubers from Czech YT scene Somebody already said that, but I would definitely have a therapy Katy Perry, I just can't get into her songs, her voice is really weird (except Firework) Ariana Grande, her songs sound almost the same and her voice is very, very boring Billie Eilish, she is talented, but I feel like most of her songs are written to be deep but they actually aren't. I just think she needs some time to really become good artist, the pressure is probably too much for her, she seems scared. She has a big potential, I think her fame at this age might just mess it up. Also, her fanbase is something I can't stand up talented guy, but the lyrics... I would need to be drunk to enjoy his music Partying, being in a big group of people, going out and doing stuff everyday, sleepovers... I do have friends and I love them, but I need a lot of time alone, if I'm socializing for too long my head starts aching and my hands start shaking, I feel as if I had to throw up... Socializing is a good thing, but not for me I cried while imagining it I kinda love being part of introvert club, but at the same time I would love to be extrovert, lol Indeed. The extroverted people who disrespect introverts are the worst, nothing against extroverts, but some of them just suck energy out of me I hope it gets better for you. It's hard for us introverts, so it's nice to have friends who respect you. Not anybody does understand the space we need to recover our energy... Avocados. I love them, but I always cut it when it's too raw or too old. When they love books, drawing, anime or MBTI. I also love when people are good listeners, when they don't just wait for their turn to talk but actually talk with you about stuff you like and care. Tomorrow. I always write two M instead of two R. Also, Wednesday and February... When I like the job I'm doing, I get really focused and nothing can distract me until I'm done. I don't work very fast, but the result is high in quality and I'm pretty proud of that. I am also very open about many stuff that are taboo for other people,for example menstruation. Few of my friends said they aren't ashamed of it and don't worry to ask for a tampon anymore because I helped them open about it. Not much good. A lot of anxiety attack, people tell me I'm paranoid and I often see things that apper to not exist. I would love to go to a therapist but my mom thinks psychologist are useless and all you get from a therapy are 999999 illnesses you didn't even know about and bunch of pills instead of solving problem. Searching a mental help is one of the things I'm gonna do once I turn 18 or get out of my house. Matcha, salty caramel or tonka beans My girlfriend helped me a lot, but I never got out of it. I cut myself for the last time about 3 weeks ago but I wasn't far from doing that again recently. I usually do that when I have anxiety attack and I don't remember doing that, I just have and feel the scar. My friends let me try mariuana to control my attacks and it helped a lot. Fuck people who smoke just for fun or bcs it's cool or what, but it can be used as a cure if you don't smoke too much and know well your dealer. I hope I can control my attacks without mariuana as soon as possible and 100% stop cutting and beating myself. I like autumn, bcs it's cold but not too much, the trees look pretty and it feels nice to have a warm soup, tea or chocolate milk. Reading books and drawing also feels different during this season. The days ate getting shorter so I like to light some candles instead of turning on the light. I also love wearing thick jumpers and hoodies or wearing fluffy socks. Winter is also great, but it's too cold and the snow is pretty but I don't like walking in it. And the fluffy socks #10084; #65039; I usually put my alarm close enough to hear it but far enough so I have to get out of bed to stop it. I also put other stuff like bottle of water or my glasses far away from my bed so I have to get out of bed to get em. I became vegan and I had to check what I'm eating. When I found out what I was putting inside of my body, I started to care more about eating healthy. I stopped being vegan about 8 months ago and I'm only vegetarian, but I still care about the food I'm eating. I don't have ideal figure but I feel healthy and I don't weigh as much as I did before. You don't need to go to a diet, just don't eat shit and chemicals and find a way to enjoy exercising. I would give up touch, taste and hearing. I love food but I enjoy the smell more than taste and I love how my gf smells, I think I would survive without touch and I love silence a lot. Anything between 25-30 I stopped eating meat because I told myself this. I would never put meat in my mouth again. It was my 5th birthday and I made some friends, so I invited them thinking they would wish me nice birthday and celebrate with me. Most of them didn't even talk with me, they just went into my room, took out my toys and played with them. If anybody talked to me, it was Why didn't you invite ____? Why do you only have one cake? and other shit. I tried to join the kids playing but nobody wanted to play with me, so I just went into my room and read and waited for kids to leave. Nobody really cleaned anything, some of my toys were broken and food was all over the floor. They ate almost everything, I didn't even taste my own cake. It was a breaking point for my anxiety, I didn't have a birthday party since then and I have hard time trusting people. I was a happy energetic kid before but I turned cold, anxious and I had a first experience with self harming about a week about the party - I bit myslef or beat myself. It literally destroyed my personality. She lets her mother manipulate her, she is 18 but I think her mother treats her as a 10 year old and she doesn't have a problem with that. I think early teen age, because you get first acne, hair, menstruation (if you are a girl, of course), it all is new and hormones go crazy and you have to deal with it. Then 18-25 bscause of stress at school, getting job, looking for your future husband/wife, people expect you to grow up from a teen to a mature adult. Then 70+ because of the health problems, losing your friends and partner, loneliness etc Tattoo artist I like coffee or green tea Indeed. Thanks for reading my story. I hate when there aren't allergens in the menu. I'm not allergic to any food, but this makes me suspicious. Good manners and not talking too much. Just say what's on your mind, then shut up. I am very formal when I meet new people, I usually need to know a person for over 2 years before I open up with them, so I like when they take everything slow and don't try to have a personal talk with me. That's why I don't have friends, lol I am a girl who likes girls. Oh crap. What a nightmare. I need to be punished. The worst part of hell for me. Meat Go back in time and delete human species Menstrual cramps and back pain (I have scoliosis) Me too I always worry about breathing too loud. I would breathe slowly and just a little bit of air so nobody would hear me. My classmate who sat next to me said he checks on me if I'm still alive, lol Bras, wigs I feel like religions have no place in this century. It has done its job explaining what people didn't understand before, now we have science and facts. There is no god and never was, no Satan, no hell, no heaven... The only things we have from religinos nowadays are fights, hate and wasted time. Believing is one thing, but spending time in churches or doing some rituals is a wasted time. The stupidest thing about that are parents forcing their children to be brainwashed. Believe whatever you want, but think about your time and don't use your god to explain or suppress things. Thanks. People should learn facts instead of wasting time sitting in the church thinking some kind of entity would make their wishes come true and make them happy. Not much different from little kids believing in Santa Claus, fairies or unicorns. But the kids at least grow up and learn to live with the truth. Drugs When did you make me? I asked when I was 7. My dad told me I was his Christmas present. I didn't understand because I wasn't born on Christmas. Now I understand. What are the most uncomfortable activities or positions for you as a owner of peepee? One girl in my class was supposed to make a sentence \"I don't like when my brother annoys me when chewing too loud.\" She said ,,I haven't like when my brother me poison biting much loud.\" That's how our native language works - we say haven't like instead of don't like, we have the same word for poisoning and annoying or chewing and biting, and we say me annoys instead of annoys me. Her English didn't improve since then, I would say it's even worse. Piercings, tattoos, ginger or unnatural hair color or eye lenses, body modifications (not all of them, I don't like scarification, elf ears or coloured eye whites or any too extreme modification. Few piercings, few tattoos, I don't like extremes). At the same time, I love if person doesn't wear any make up or when girl doesn't shave her legs. Man fucking woman wearing tampon. No, they didn't have anal sex. Sushi at my favourite restaurant. The best one I ever had. Yup, September Fuck the person he was cheating with Good luck You're just lazy. Your life must be boring. I will invite some more people so it's not just the two of us. You only look at your phone and don't even go out of your room. I will call, texting is boring. You have no life. Small talk is fun. I don't understand you. Books are bullshit. Drawing is bullshit. You only think of yourself. Stop over thinking. Internet friends aren't real friends. Introversion doesn't exist, it's just people being lazy or mentally ill. You should see psychologist. You don't look like you are introvert. You are not shy, you are just not being honest. You only think about stuff, why don't you do stuff? If everyone was like you, humanity would propably still be in caves. You have no future. You are wird. You won't get job like this. When did you become like this? You must have trauma/be depressed. I'm glad I'm not like you. Why don't you make more friends, you only have few. No successful people are introverts. Go talk to people, it will make you energetic. There's more. I also hate when they come to your house without asking or talk without thinking or without breaks. Once dated extrovert, the worst relationship I ever had. I'm happy with my introverted bby now, I think I won't be able to date an extrovert ever again. People of Reddit who heard about MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), what's your type and how accurate the description of your type is? And why do you like or dislike your type? I am an INFP, very accurate for me. I love being introverted and I enjoy spending lots of time thinking, but sometimes I feel very isolated. I got this type when I tried MBTI for the first time. I really like INTPs, you are nice and smart people Glad to hear! I love the joy and energy around ESTPs, agree you are fun people! It's indeed both nice and scary how accurate it can be Sometimes it's better when somebody who knows you well tells you what is accurate about you or what type exactly you are. We are all unique individuals, so it's important to be a bit sceptical Glad you are happy with your type! Oh, that's my favourite type! I read INFPs help others a lot as well, and I don't feel like that too. We can't be 100% as the description says, but that doesn't mean you aren't good person. Your differences are what makes you an amazing person. It indeed is. I think introverts wouldn't be that shy if they were treated better, we would still enjoy time alone and have few close friends but we would be more confident and more open about ourselves. And when you tell them to be quiet they will be mean or louder. Know that feeling. I understand some people need something to believe in, the people I hate are the ones who use their god as an excuse for everything or force their religion to others. I was buying cola and there was a kid staring at me with a serious face. I asked him what's wrong and he said slowly, with unnaturally serious voice \"Cola is poisonous. Don't drink it or you wil die in pain.\" Not the scaries5 thing to hear but I returned the cola and bought mineral water to be a good example. I met him again after a while and he gave me such a sweet smile when he saw me holding a water and said to his mom \"Look! I saved her life when telling her to not buy cola!\" His mom was very proud of him and thanked me for being a good example. I felt so bad for the kid when drinking and eating unhealthy so I started eating healthier. I never thought a little guy could completely change my diet. Dark chocolate. As bitter as my mood I would get super depressed. You would see all your loved ones die, all the wars and climate changes, even the end od of the world What's the most re-asked question on AskReddit? My friend's mom didn't want to \"waste\" money on a cage for a guinea pig so they kept it in a bathtub until they got one from their grandma. When they wanted to take a bath, they put it and all its stuff into a box. A lot of books and tickets for a flight to Japan or East Korea and back for me and my family and girlfriend. Face tattoos. Some people might have nice ones, but think how will you look like when you are 40, 50, 60... and you won't be able to hide it with clothing. Cancer by My Chemical Romance and Drown by Bring Me The Horizon Thanks for mortality. It actually makes life meaningful Glass of water, half full and half empty :) Yea, but if somebody told me I am never going to die, I would get depressed about it for a while. I would get out of it and live normally, but as you said it would hit me later I dreamt about being back in 3rd grade and we had sex and porn as a subject. We only learnt theory but at high schools you would learn how to do it by doing it. Why is it \"sexy\" or \"cool\" when a girl dresses or acts a bit masculine but when a guy acts or dresses feminine he would be called gay, weird or disgusting by other men? (I don't mean transsexuality) Pasta. I love pasta, it's simple to make and there are so many ways to make a dish with it. I also think sushi would be fun, I would like to try different combinations or give people opportunity to make a custom sushi - you would have a paper of ingredients and you could choose what type of sushi you want and what do you want in it. Each ingredient would have certain price and people would mark what do they want. There might me restaurants like that but I never saw any near my city and I would love it. I agree with that face-showing, but I feel bad for men who don't like men's fashion or stereotypical behavior but if they want to be themselves, they will be punished by society. Some people would consider face-showing even a man walking out of his house in skirt or wearing makeup, even tho he just feels better that way Kimi no na wa, Koe no Katachi. Hello, I am weeb She was forcing me to go out a lot, socialize, she was too extroverted for me. She was nice and energetic, but I was exhausted and if I stayed with her for the rest of my life, we would propably end up living two separate lives, she would travel and socialize and I would stay in my room and paint and read, so it wouldn't last. When I told her about breakup, she said she was thinking about it as well because she wasn't sure if she is a lesbian or not. Turned out she wasn't, she has a guy now and we are both happy. I get very unmotivated to do stuff that would normally make me happy and I just lie in my bed not doing anything for hours and hours. When I have the worst days I forget things, memories blend together and I have problems remembering details. Everything is dark and blur and it makes depression even worse. People think I hate them because I often avoid them so I have a hard time keeping relationships. You have better days but it never goes away and it's exhausting. I think I would be that kind of person everyone was afraid of so I was burned alive, drowned or stabbed to death. Wish I could be where you are Art lessons. It might be boring for some people but if you have a good teacher who actually knows some art, you can get better imagination. That's also problem with schools (or at least at my school), cuz people think anyone can teach art. Most of teachers we had just found some \"art\" on Google, figured out how could it be made and told us to do it. My classmates who aren't in any art clubs have no idea what art is, when they see abstract art they say they could do it as well and give it some poetic name. No, you couldn't, because nobody teached you to have imagination and you propably would even know how to mix the colors. You maybe don't need to paint well to get a job, but you might need an imagination to do it well. That's too scary for others and traumatic for the kids. Focusing on your breath. Each breath in and out should be long and I like to count how long does each last. Makes you focused and calmer. If you say it like that... You don't live if you don't actually live your life and only survive. My black shirt with white crosses or my black skirt. I also love all of my thick jumpers I had a panic attack after triggering one traumatic memory. I couldn't get myself together and cried and had problems breathing and my friend told me she does have nerves for my shit and I should pack my things and go home. I went out and sat next to a tree for like 15 minutes before I had a strenght to go home. I don't under how could I ever be friends with her, she only cares about her looks and if you tell the stuff she wants to hear. I posted art on G+ and she liked it, whe started talking a lot and we found out we have a lot in common so we bwcame very close friends amd on 24th May 2017 we got together. You are welcome! Thank you as well! INFP. I enjoy reading, drawing, writing stories or watching movies or series, but most of the activities seem more interesting when done without people. You can only focus on what you're doing and you aren't interrupted by some person talking crap. Few trustworthy friends. I do have some \"friends\" but I don't really consider anyone my actual friend and I don't feel a need to have any. People, it's hard but it's fascinating how the drawing turns out depending on how you feel about the person. Lesbians, cuz I'm bi and girl just knows what feels good better than a man. No offense, but you know how I mean it. Introversion and piercings and small tattoos. Ariana Grande cuz she has very annoying voice, stupid videos and weird personality. Also, the lyrics of her songs... I don't understand the hype, she seems like a slut to me. I never really made friends because I didn't feel any need have to any, I was adopted by some extroverts or I met them because my mom knew their parents. But if you want to make friends yourself, maybe show them you admire them, you have same hobbies and be open to their opinions?? I don't know, lol. Good luck finding helpful answer, tho. To make them feel good and confident. I wouldn't compliment someone for something I don't think is true, so I am always honest. They judge people by their looks, they only want you to say what they want to hear or they call you when they need your help and when you do your job they don't want to be with you anymore. Try meat alternatives. You can also try other animal product alternatives (soy milk, vegan cheese,...), it's all delicious and you get more used to the plant taste! Sushi and pistachios Sushi and avocados. Bread with butter and tomatoes Physical education. I understand teachers want to lead children to sports, but I never had a teacher who wouldn't make fun of my abilities. Hiding in bathroom on my firts day in the kindergarten. I did that everyday for about 2,5 years because I thought other children are going to hurt me. I was a paranoid kid. A lot of time alone. It's boring for many people but if I could, I would spend whole month at home reading, drawing, watching movies and thinking a lot without talking to people. I love my friends a lot but I need a lot of privacy. 9-13 #176;C So people read my comments and respond to them. Forcing me their opinions and beliefs or forcing me to socialize. With a book or a paper and pencil (or any other art supply, of course) I would have a very fluffy cat and a lots of hair around the house, which is already true (my cat's name is Fluffy) and my brother's rabbit would sing and be annoying (his name is Alvin) Not the worse, but after reading Ready Player One, I was very, very disappointed Tofu, a lot of people say it tastes like a wet sponge. Well yea, but try to not eat it raw Too introverted Telling me to not wear some clothes, like leggins, shorts, two-piece swimsuits,... That periods aren't that regular and you can miss one. I got my third period two months late and I thought somebody raped me while I was asleep and I got pregnant. People all over the world, what is some movie from your country everyone should watch? Why do you think so and what is the movie about? I am usually very, very silent and bad at having conversations, so I am basically extrovert when I'm drunk She realised she is heterosexual. Met my gf. We have long-distance relationship #268;ern #225;, st #345; #237;brn #225; Czech language, means black and silver I had a cat plushie with a little bag on its belly. I would always write my thoughts on a little piece of paper and put it in a bag and I called it a memory kitty. I love it, but I'm kinda picky so I hardly ever finish watching it and there is only few of them I loved. I hate most of the fans around me, annoying weebs. Vegan dishes. I am not vegan but I love vegan food, the plant taste is just amazing (if it's not made with chemicals, of course), but most people around me won't eat food that is vegan just because it has \"vegan\" on it. Like... It's not poisonous, you eat vegetables with meat as well Vegan kimchi burger, absolutely amazing with sweet potato fries Helena by My Chemical Romance Exactly. Soft boiled eggs, boiled 6-7 minutes #128076; #127995; Tamago (Japanese) Short bangs, ginger hair and freckles = perfection #128076; #127995; I'm lucky to date such a pretty girl Lol, I prefer more orange than red hair I didn't have time to paint her nails, so she went crazy. Like very, VERY crazy. I keep my cat in my room anytime I feel like I want to cut myself. I would feel guilty if he had to see me like this, so it usually helps a lot. Also playing with him or cuddling him helps a lot, it makes me feel loved.\n",
